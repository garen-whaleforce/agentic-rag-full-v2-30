ORIGINAL EARNINGS CALL TRANSCRIPT:
---
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NRG Energy, Inc. Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Brendan Mulhern, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brendan Mulhern: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast. The webcast presentation and earnings release can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation and earnings release. With that, I will now turn it over to Larry Coben, NRG's Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Lawrence Coben: Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your continued interest in NRG. I'm joined today by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our management team are also on the line and available to answer questions. Let's start with the key messages on Slide 4. Strong performance across all areas of the business led us to raise 2025 financial guidance by $100 million in late September. This is the third consecutive year we have increased our full year outlook. And today, we are reaffirming that higher range. We are also introducing 2026 guidance that aligns with our long-term growth targets. This represents NRG's stand-alone outlook and excludes any contribution from the LS Power acquisition. We will provide updated guidance that includes LS Power around the time of closing. We expanded our data center power agreements this quarter, bringing total contracted capacity to 445 megawatts. We also rapidly grew our pipeline of potential projects under joint development and letters of intent to 5.4 gigawatts. Together, these actions build on the agreement announced in August and reflect rapidly growing momentum and validation of our data center strategy. The LS Power acquisition remains on track. Financings were executed in September on favorable terms. All regulatory filings have been submitted, and we expect to close in the first quarter of 2026. Turning to Slide 5. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was 32% higher than the same period last year, and adjusted EBITDA reached the highest quarterly level in company history. I'd like to pause to congratulate all 18,000 of our employees for that achievement. Our results reflect strong performance across both Energy and Smart Home. In Energy, supply optimization and disciplined commercial execution drove margin improvement across both our home and C&I businesses. In Smart Home, growth was supported by expanding our customer base, record retention and continued momentum in our home virtual power plant initiative. We also delivered top decile safety performance and completed the loan agreement for our second Texas Energy Fund project. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS is 36% higher than last year, reflecting strong performance across all parts of the business as well as continued cost discipline. These results keep us firmly on track to achieve our raised full year 2025 guidance ranges. On the right side of the slide, we are introducing 2026 guidance on a stand-alone basis. This serves as an interim view ahead of a full update after the LS Power acquisition closes when we will provide guidance for the combined company. Moving to Slide 6 for an update on market conditions. ERCOT experienced a mild summer with moderate pricing and strong growth in overall power use. Total consumption across Texas has increased nearly 30% over the past 5 years, driven by residential, commercial and industrial demand as electrification and onshoring of manufacturing accelerate. Data center development usage remains early with ramp schedules expected to add meaningful capacity over the next several years. Looking ahead, power demand is projected to outpace new supply, keeping the market structurally tight and reinforcing the need for reliable, dispatchable generation. Policymakers are responding through initiatives such as Senate Bill 6 in Texas and similar efforts in other regions focused on affordability, additionality and reliability. We are encouraged by the focus and progress being made to strengthen ERCOT and other competitive markets across the country. In this environment, NRG is expanding its portfolio of reliable and flexible capacity. Through the LS Power and Rockland acquisitions, the Texas Energy Fund projects and our home virtual power plant, we are adding 15 gigawatts of natural gas and 7 gigawatts of virtual power plant capacity. We also see about 6 gigawatts of additional opportunities through the GE Vernova partnership and our final TEF project that is still under review. Together, these actions strengthen our platform and position NRG to meet rising customer demand and support large load growth, including data centers across ERCOT, PJM and other key markets. Turning to Slide 7. We expanded our data center customer portfolio through 150 megawatts of new premium long-term power agreements, bringing total contracted capacity to 445 megawatts across ERCOT and PJM. This builds on the framework announced last quarter with the same customer. These sites located in Maryland and Illinois support edge data center development with access to high-capacity fiber and proximity to major U.S. cities. These projects will be built in PJM with operations beginning in 2028 and ramping through 2032. This agreement was signed above the midpoint of our prior $70 to $90 per megawatt hour target range. Given continued strength in customer demand and higher forward power curves, we are raising our target for new long-term data center agreements to above $80 per megawatt hour. This reflects sustained pricing improvement and NRG's leadership in providing reliable long-term power solutions for large load customers. We are advancing numerous additional opportunities, including up to 5.4 gigawatts of new capacity for data centers through 2032 under our GE Vernova and Kiewit partnership, supporting the principle of additionality. Since last quarter, signed letters of intent have increased 35%, underscoring customer engagement from multiple hyperscalers and data center developers as well as growing demand for new development. We also see several additional gigawatts of potential projects across our broader pipeline. As markets evolve to bring your own generation models, NRG is leading the next phase of data center growth. Turning to Slide 8. The LS Power acquisition remains firmly on track for a first quarter 2026 close. It strengthens our platform, broadens our earnings base and extends our reach across key competitive markets. It reinforces our position as one of the largest competitive generators in the country and increases our leverage to long-term demand growth. At announcement, the acquisition was immediately accretive across all key metrics, reflecting portfolio quality and an attractive purchase multiple. We also unveiled a 14% EPS CAGR through 2029, which does not -- I repeat, does not include any contribution from data centers and reflects pricing assumptions that are below current market levels. These factors, along with other upside opportunities underscore the significant potential ahead. Since announcement, incremental benefits, including 100% bonus depreciation have further enhanced the economics. All required filings have been submitted and financing was completed on terms better than originally projected. The transaction positions NRG for stronger long-term growth, greater scale and enhanced value creation as we bring the 2 platforms together. With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce for the financial review.
Bruce Chung: Thank you, Larry. Beginning with Slide 10, NRG delivered strong financial and operational performance in the third quarter with $2.78 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.205 billion in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 32% and 14% increase from the same quarter of 2024, respectively. Adjusted net income was $537 million and free cash flow before growth was $828 million. Through the first 3 quarters of 2025, NRG delivered $7.17 of adjusted earnings per share and over $3.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a year-over-year increase of 36% and 12%, respectively. Our exceptional quarterly and year-to-date financial performance reflects continued execution in all of our businesses, driven primarily by a mix of expanded margins, favorable weather and excellent commercial and operational execution. Our Texas segment delivered third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $807 million and $1.618 billion, respectively, representing an improvement of 38% and 29% from the same periods in 2024. These results were driven by margin expansion across our operations in the region with lower realized supply costs and excellent optimization despite low summer volatility. The East segment contributed adjusted EBITDA of $107 million in the third quarter and $680 million through the first 3 quarters of 2025. These results reflect a modest decline from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by the net impact of higher supply costs throughout the region, partially offset by increased capacity revenues at our plants and favorable weather in the first quarter, which benefited our natural gas business. Our West Services Other segment had adjusted EBITDA of $19 million in the third quarter and $139 million for the first 3 quarters of 2025. The segment realized higher retail power margins, which were offset by the absence of earnings from the sale of our Airtron business in 2024 and the lease expiration at the Cottonwood facility in May 2025 when compared to the same period of the prior year. Our Smart Home business posted another impressive quarter and executed brilliantly through the key summer selling season, achieving adjusted EBITDA of $272 million in the third quarter and $803 million through the first 3 quarters of 2025. The segment continues to see record new customer adds and retention rates as well as expanded net service margins. Our consolidated free cash flow before growth was $828 million for the quarter and $2.035 billion for the first 3 quarters of 2025. Year-to-date free cash flow before growth exceeded the same period in 2024 by $597 million or 42%. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by the higher year-to-date adjusted EBITDA, favorable working capital timing and receipt of the remaining insurance proceeds from our Paris Unit B claims. We expect some of the year-over-year favorability to moderate as working capital timing normalizes in the first -- in the fourth quarter and as we continue to invest in our plants through our scheduled maintenance program. Looking to the remainder of 2025, we are reaffirming the increased financial guidance we announced last month with ranges of $7.55 to $8.15 for adjusted EPS $3.875 billion to $4.025 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $2.1 billion to $2.25 billion for free cash flow before growth. Moving to Slide 11 for updates to our capital allocation for the remainder of 2025. This has been updated to reflect the new midpoint of our raised free cash flow before growth guidance target, setting the total capital available for allocation in 2025 at $2.7 billion. Note that this slide excludes proceeds received from the $4.9 billion of new debt raised in October, most of which will be allocated to fund the cash portion of the pending LS Power transaction. A few other updates from what I shared in our second quarter call are denoted in light blue. Starting with an update to liability management. The $52 million increase primarily reflects transaction costs and financing fees associated with the LS Power transaction. Integration costs increased by $20 million due to a shift in spend from 2024 to 2025. The net total remained largely consistent with our communicated expectation between the 2 years. We remain on track to execute the full $1.3 billion in share repurchases slated in 2025. Through October 31, we have executed $1.084 billion in share repurchases or nearly 85% of our planned annual total at a weighted average price of $125.35 and expect to complete the full amount of share repurchases by the end of the year. Other related activities increased due to higher tax withholdings related to equity compensation resulting from the increase in our share price. The increase in the revenue synergy growth plan reflects the strong customer growth our Smart Home segment has delivered through the year. Customer growth for the business was 9% year-over-year, well surpassing the targeted 5% to 6% net customer growth embedded in our growth plan. On other investments, we are showing a net $30 million inflow of capital related to our Texas new build program. As you may recall, the stipulated capital structure for projects under the Texas Energy Fund program is 60-40 debt to equity. In order to get our TDF projects to that target capital structure, the initial disbursement under the loan took into account previously spent development costs. Given that catch-up mechanism under the loan, the disbursements we received in 2025 exceeded the amount of capital we expect to spend on the projects, therefore, resulting in a net inflow of capital for the year. Finally, we are on track to finish the year with $158 million of unallocated capital, which we currently plan to roll over into 2026 and deploy as part of our 2026 capital allocation plan. Turning to the next slide. We are initiating our 2026 NRG stand-alone financial guidance at ranges of $3.925 billion to $4.175 billion for adjusted EBITDA, representing a midpoint of $4.05 billion and free cash flow before growth of $1.975 billion to $2.225 billion, representing a midpoint of $2.1 billion. We are not providing stand-alone EPS guidance as we acknowledge that EPS will change materially with the closing of the LS Power transaction due to associated accounting adjustments, pro forma capital allocation and other matters impacting any per share financial metrics. As you can see on the slide, we have included the same adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth for the acquisition, which we provided when we originally announced the transaction in May. This, combined with the 2026 NRG stand-alone guidance that we are initiating today should remind people of the pro forma company's earnings profile. We will provide an updated pro forma view once the transaction is closed, which we -- which will include updates to items like energy and capacity prices, accelerated depreciation benefits and pro forma capital allocation, among others. On the bottom of the page, we have provided walks from the midpoint of our original 2025 guidance to the midpoint of our new 2026 guidance on a stand-alone NRG basis. For adjusted EBITDA, the net $200 million increase year-over-year is primarily driven by the addition of the Rockland assets acquired earlier in the year, the impact of higher power pricing in our Texas segment and the continued execution of our existing $750 million growth plan. The impact of higher power pricing in Texas that we are showing is consistent with the sensitivities we have provided in our previous earnings materials and reflect an increase in around-the-clock pricing from the $47 we previously used to $53 per megawatt hour, which reflects Texas pricing at the end of July. The sum total of these year-over-year increases is slightly offset by other minor drivers such as regulatory developments negatively impacting the Maryland and New York competitive retail markets and tariff impacts on our businesses. On free cash flow before growth, we are -- we expect strong year-over-year growth from core operations amounting to $145 million, comprised of the previously discussed EBITDA growth, partially offset by the continued investment in our generation fleet. After taking into account higher cash interest and taxes, we forecast free cash flow before growth to be flat year-over-year. The higher cash interest is largely driven by refinancing of very low-cost debt that was issued when the Fed funds rate hovered near 0%. The increase in cash taxes primarily relates to fewer federal tax credits available to offset income than in prior years. Just to reiterate, we will provide a more detailed update on pro forma financial metrics once we close the acquisition. I look forward to sharing that update with you soon. Moving to Slide 13 for a brief discussion on 2026 NRG stand-alone capital allocation. The key takeaway here is that we remain committed to our return of capital program through share repurchases of $1 billion and our planned 7% to 9% annualized growth of the common dividend per share. This is the case both on a stand-alone and pro forma basis. I'm also pleased to share that our Board has approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization to be executed through 2028. As you can imagine, certain elements of this chart, such as the starting point for excess cash and liability management will look very different after we close the acquisition. As such, I do not intend to go further into detail on this slide. We will provide a fulsome update on capital allocation alongside our key financial metrics once we close on the LS Assets acquisition. In closing, NRG has delivered outstanding financial and operational results through the first 3 quarters of this year, and we are poised to finish the year on a high note. The stand-alone 2026 financial guidance and capital allocation outlook I have shared today further demonstrates the solid growth and continued performance of our stand-alone base business. I look forward to providing you updated and detailed guidance for 2026 that includes the assets we are acquiring from LS Power following the closing of the transaction. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry.
Lawrence Coben: Thank you, Bruce. Turning to Slide 15. 2025 has been an outstanding year across every part of our business, and our outlook continues to improve. Our near-term focus is on completing the LS Power acquisition and providing you with an updated long-term outlook following the close. We also continue expanding our data center portfolio, advancing our Texas energy projects, including completing the construction of the T.H. Wharton project and returning at least $1.3 billion to shareholders. These priorities reflect a disciplined approach to growth and capital allocation as we position NRG for 2026 and beyond, continuing to build a company defined by consistent execution and accelerating value creation. With that, we'll now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Wells Fargo.
Lawrence Coben: Welcome back to the workforce.
Shahriar Pourreza: I'm ready to go back to Garden to be honest.
Lawrence Coben: I want to see the flowers.
Shahriar Pourreza: So Larry, just do you think '26 is kind of that year you're going to be able to announce a data center agreement that includes new development as part of your GEV, Kiewit partnership?
Lawrence Coben: Yes.
Shahriar Pourreza: You tongue tied me again.
Lawrence Coben: Well, you remember the last time I gave you a one-word answer, it showed up. So I'm giving you a one-word answer.
Shahriar Pourreza: Any sense around timing next year? Are we thinking back half or earlier part of the year?
Lawrence Coben: It's hard to tell, Shar. As my good friend, Max said yesterday, these are complex, but super excited by the process and never been more sure.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, just maybe share a little bit more about sort of the announced data center deals, how they kind of compare to those announced by your peers. So a little bit more color around the margins given other peer deals that come with generation linkages.
Lawrence Coben: Yes. We put a little slide in the appendix, which kind of talks about margin and pricing. This is very similar to the one that we announced last quarter, just locationally different. Premium margin as a result of different things go into getting our premium margin on any deal, including land, including our commercial acumen. I mean I really need to say we have the best commercial team in the business at both gas and electricity, being able to really meet customer needs in a flexible way, all of those lead to the margin that you see on that appendix chart.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Let's -- let me jump back to the -- let me ask the same question that our buddy just asked a second ago in a different way. Look, as far as GEV goes in this Kiewit partnership, do you have a certain time frame that you need to move some of this equipment, use it or lose it, if you will? Can you speak to that a little bit? Because I think that's probably an important nuance to speak to when you talk about your confidence and the time lines under which you're operating to execute on this.
Lawrence Coben: Look, Julien, we haven't disclosed any time lines, but we're -- I'm very confident that we're going to meet all of the time lines that are required under that agreement. But what you're really trying to do, Julien, and I know is pin me to a month, and I'm not going to let you do that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. You know what we're all trying. I mean start too.
Lawrence Coben: [indiscernible] Well done, but...
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Not quite there. All right. I got it. Well, let me ask it this way. As far as it goes with the build your own power, BYOP as we're calling it, right, like there's clearly been an evolution in the marketplace. When you think about the scope of what's possible here, again, I know folks have been looking at co-located opportunities in the last couple of years, but now we firmly shifted. How meaningful, right? We've seen a few announcements here with a couple of hundred megawatts here, a couple of hundred megawatts this quarter. I mean when you say you're going to deliver updates next year, can you speak to BYOP and the scale of what's at hand here in terms of really building out contracted jet?
Lawrence Coben: Sure. Look, just starting with the GEV, Kiewit deal, Julien, that's 5.4 gigs. So that's a good place to start from. I mean there are some things that could be added to that in a variety of ways that we're looking at. But I think if we brought even 5.4 gigs to the table, you would be and everyone would be super happy from us. So I mean, the scale -- I mean, that's kind of the scale that we're focused on right now, but we are looking at opportunities to see how we can make that even greater.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. And then let me just shift this slightly. When you think about the focus here, I mean, a lot of conversation has been around your portfolio in Texas and ERCOT specifically. Can you speak a little bit more broadly? Obviously, you guys have Illinois site, PJM is talking increasingly about bringing new assets to fore. Illinois just passed legislation in recent weeks. For instance, is there an opportunity in the PJM portfolio to both add gen -- add gas and storage specifically and perhaps tap into some of these developments that have been recently put to kind of quell the state's needs for new capacity?
Lawrence Coben: Absolutely, Julien. And we are working hard on that, and we'll really accelerate those efforts, of course, once LS closes because until we own the generation assets there, that will really fault us into being a significant player, but there's no grass growing under our feet there in the meantime.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. And Illinois legislation, is there something for you guys to do there specifically to ask that more pointedly?
Lawrence Coben: I don't think the legislation is really going to be the driver of this, Julien. So -- but as you know, we do have sites in Illinois. So...
Operator: Our next question comes from Agnie Storozynski with Seaport.
Agnieszka Storozynski: So first of all -- now I see the slide showing the sensitivity of your gross margin to changes in forward power curves. I mean we've had finally the move in curves we had waited for. And so I'm just wondering if anything has changed there? Are you waiting to update it for your enlarged portfolio? Any comments?
Lawrence Coben: Agnie, you just hit the nail on the head. We are waiting to update it for our enlarged portfolio.
Agnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And you're not going to give me any sense how -- especially the PJM price is moving, how they are impacting the pro forma EBITDA of the company for now?
Lawrence Coben: Not at this stage. Well, certainly, we will provide, obviously, a very fulsome update soon after we close on the transaction.
Agnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then the second thing is, so we've had some companies, new power companies or pretending to be new power companies that have aspirations to build gas plants without any prior expertise in power. So I mean, it is surprising that they could be ahead of you in the pecking order. It's not for the fact that you guys actually have sites, have equipment, know how to hedge gas, et cetera. So is it that they just talk more about their opportunities versus you guys? Or do you still feel like you have a head start over those companies?
Lawrence Coben: Agnie, I'm convinced that we're in a great position to do what I was describing. We had this a long time, so of you, there's a lot of announcements -- when I actually see to use Sam Altman's new term electrons flowing, then I will actually believe that they're real or you'll see steel in the ground. But we're not one -- we tell you what we've done. We don't tell you what we're going to do, and that's kind of my philosophy in all this. So there's going to be a lot of announcements because a lot of people think they're data center and power developers. Some of those are probably real, but I'm very, very comfortable with where we sit in the pecking order, both with respect to building power plants and with respect to hyperscalers.
Agnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then one more. I mean, we are still seeing a lot of assets, private assets being offered to companies like you, hopefully. You do have a large pending acquisition. And I'm just wondering if you would still have interest in single asset transactions before the LS Power transaction closes.
Lawrence Coben: We look at everything. And if there's something that's economically attractive, that's a great fit for our portfolio, we would be interested. We don't feel we need to add any additional capacity given the LS acquisition, the Rockford acquisition and the TEF projects, but we are always opportunistic when these things are out there.
Agnieszka Storozynski: And then lastly, Bruce, you mentioned the free cash flow guidance for '26 and the fact that you're sort of running out of the tax shield. I mean, the LS Power transaction brings the tax shield, right? So there would be presumably an improvement sort of free cash flow generation of the current business on the back of that transaction. Is that fair?
Bruce Chung: Yes, I think that's generally a fair statement, Agnie. The one thing that I'll just clarify for you is that uptick in cash tax that we talk about on a stand-alone basis isn't necessarily related to our NOLs disappearing. It's really more about certain tax credits that we had from our days when we owned renewable assets that eventually expired. And so regardless of the LS transaction, we're still going to have a very sizable NOL position. But clearly, the LS transaction is going to give us even more, which should inure to a cash flow benefit.
Operator: Next question comes from James West with Melius Research.
James West: Larry, in your prepared comments, both at the beginning and the end, I think you made it very clear that you guys are not just standing still waiting to close OS, but you've got a lot of other things going on. If you were to kind of rank order what you're most excited about outside of that transaction, what would you say are the top kind of 1, 2, 3 other things or items that you're waiting to hopefully announce to us in the near term?
Lawrence Coben: I'm going to do them in no particular order because otherwise, that's like picking favorites among your kids.
James West: Understood.
Lawrence Coben: I mean we have -- both on the C&I and on the retail side and energy and in Smart, we have a lot of -- people have kind of lost sight of. We have a very exciting growth plan where we're killing it. Second, our residential VPP excites me tremendously. And after LS close, I'm also even more excited about our demand response potential. So I look at all of those things. And I guess the fourth thing I would say is bringing our first project online and making progress on the other 2. So there's a lot going on here that we don't -- we haven't even begun to put into our numbers. And -- so even if there were no -- I just -- as a reminder, even if there were no data centers at all and no changes in power prices, we're still showing a 14% CAGR, and we still have a double-digit free cash flow discount rate. So I'm sorry, I'm super excited about that. I don't know where I could get in the market such as -- with not much downside, those kind of numbers, leaving out all the other great things that we're doing. So I am as bullish as I've ever been.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays.
Nicholas Campanella: Maybe I could just follow up on the BYOP combo, just your conversation with policymakers at the states you operate in, how does that look in terms of BYOP? How have the customer conversations evolved over the last 6 months? And is it a fair assumption that all deals going forward just need some type of additionality in this space now? Or how would you kind of frame that?
Lawrence Coben: I mean I don't -- speaking to all deals is hard, but it starts with the Secretary of Energy, who's been very, very explicit on this. And I think as regulators more and more look at the affordability question and how to distribute the cost of this new power, the simplest way to do it and the fairest way to do it, I think, is probably bring your own gen. Now whether that's megawatt hour per megawatt hour or 75% or 50% or some other measure, I think, remains to be seen. But I think every policymaker is looking at this for 2 reasons. One is the affordability factor and two is everyone knows they need new power. Everyone knows they need new infrastructure. So to the extent if you're the governor of, say, New Jersey or Pennsylvania or somewhere like that, you would rather spread that cost across Amazon or Meta or Googles or Microsoft's billions of customers around the world rather than your own rate payers. So this is a trend that we started talking about a year ago and prepared for it with our GEV and Kiewit joint venture, and it's now really coming home to roost and accelerating in the last few months.
Nicholas Campanella: Definitely recognize that. Maybe just with PJM being a more important jurisdiction pro forma of this LS Power deal. Can you talk about the capacity auction and just the prospects and timing for the collar to potentially be extended or just what you're advocating for with stakeholders, where you think the industry is heading and ultimately, what outcome you think would be good for the industry?
Unknown Executive: It's Rob. Look, nothing's changed since the last auction as far as supply and demand. So I would expect that, that means that we're going to price at the top of that cap and collar. The -- as far as long term goes, they're looking at lots of different ways to solve the equation. Ultimately, we -- everybody is generally concerned about reliability and they're concerned about things like affordability. But in order to get reliability, you have to have price signals. And so the market has to reflect something for something to get built. As far as the collar being extended, we were supportive of the collar last time. I could see it being extended again because it provides certainty for everyone in the market. Whether or not the top end of that collar is at the right place, that's yet to be determined.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.
Carly Davenport: Larry, you mentioned before your excitement about the resi VPP program and the pilot there. I guess, any updates on how that's tracking in terms of uptake? And is that something that we should expect to see sort of regular updates on in subsequent calls?
Lawrence Coben: Yes. I'm going to kick that over to Brad.
Unknown Executive: Thank you. Yes. No, we've been very pleased with the progress from VPP. So as you're aware, we did raise guidance earlier this year for the balance of '25. So we went from 20 megawatts to 150, and we remain on track for our 1 gig by year-end. We received a lot of...[indiscernible] We received a lot of great feedback from customers about the value and the experience of our offering. So we're really excited about that, and we're actually installing more customers than anticipated. And I think as we had shared in our last earnings, we're actually seeing the upgrade of additional equipment kind of 2x our expectations. But apart from that, we're also piloting some additional new home automation offerings which not only deliver the demand response, but will also help reduce home energy consumption, which will enable us to offer customers home energy savings. So as affordability and grid capacity become more critical, energy will really have the only solution to meet those needs to be able to reduce energy consumption and save customers money. So we're really excited about piloting that, not just in Texas, but we will also be taking that out to the East early next year.
Carly Davenport: Great. Okay. That's super helpful. And then maybe just on the data center pipeline, you have one agreement with first delivery in '26, another in '28. I guess, is there any trends that you're seeing in terms of when customers are looking to be energized on these fields?
Lawrence Coben: I mean I think they're looking to be energized as quickly as possible, but there are some bottlenecks, as you know, with interconnection and things of that nature as well as if you do really need to bring your own power plant, obviously, that doesn't occur in a day. So I think customers are -- would love to start ramping yesterday, and they're doing what they can to do that. But I think if I look at the graph from now through 2031, there's more and more power coming on ramping each of those years. So I don't think anybody comes to the table thinking, well, we really want to start in 2033, but I think they're also realistic about building their own businesses and the constraints that exist.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: When you say that you're -- let's see, on the data center power agreements, increasing your kind of expectations for pricing to now be above $80 a megawatt hour. What's that reflecting? Is that a reflection of where market prices have gone? And just thinking about the upper end of your prior $70 to $90 range, like does that upper end go up as well? Kind of curious just like would you be repricing like bring your own power type deals also upward?
Lawrence Coben: I think everything is pricing upward as a result of increasing demand. If you look at the capital expenditure announcements by the hyperscalers, they continue to rapidly increase across the board. I think it's a recognition from people of the commercial -- of our rather unique ability commercially to supply them in ways that they want to be supplied and to bring new power to the table and just really heightened interest from multiple hyperscalers and developers in a very accelerating fashion, just kind of using the basic laws of supply and demand. So all of those are factors that led us to raise this really to kind of take the top of the range and raise the bottom of the range.
David Arcaro: Got it. Okay. Great. That's helpful. Then separately, I was just wondering if you could comment on the retail competitive backdrop, retail -- your outlook for retail margins from here? Can they remain strong looking out at your forecast?
Unknown Executive: Yes. We have -- this is Brad. We continue to see strong margins in Texas. And we have had -- primarily because it's a competitive marketplace. And so as prices have gone up, we've been able to maintain those margins. As I mentioned earlier, we are looking at solutions to help give some customers relief in terms of helping reduce energy consumption. As we know, affordability will be a challenge as everyone does raise prices. In the East, a little bit different dynamic when we're up against the price to compare. And so that one, we have seen a little bit of margin erosion that we are managing very closely. But as I mentioned earlier, being able to bring an integrated value proposition to the consumer that gets beyond competing for price per kilowatt hour and give them a solution that actually brings their energy consumption down and give them home protection and home automation in the home. We believe that's a solution that we will be able to scale and slightly change the conversation. So a little bit different dynamic, as you know, between the East and what we see in Texas.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.
Ryan Levine: Hoping to follow up on the Smart Home business. Good to see the 9% annual year-over-year growth there. What are you assuming for '26 stand-alone business contribution for Smart Home growth? And how do you see that trend evolving into your longer-term outlook?
Lawrence Coben: Yes. In terms of customer counts, we're assuming something very similar to what we saw this year. We've seen really strong growth across really all of our channels of distribution. We're also launching more of a good, better, best. Historically, Vivint has been pushing the higher-end systems, but we're able to, as I mentioned earlier, offer a much more affordable entry-level offering that not only gives customers some security protection, but also that energy management savings that I touched on. So with the additional kind of good, better, best, it opens up new channels of distribution. And so we expect really strong growth in '26 as well.
Bruce Chung: Ryan, I just want to remind when we announced that $750 million growth plan, we had indicated Smart Home net customer growth to be in that 5% to 6% range. And so I think when Brad alludes to the customer growth that we're assuming for '26, it's still going to be pretty consistent with that original growth plan -- probably higher.
Ryan Levine: And then in terms of the hyperscaler data center conversations, I appreciate the additional guidance around pricing and momentum. But in terms of duration of the contracts, are you seeing any change there around the tenor of contracts that the customers are looking for as demand has continued to accelerate?
Lawrence Coben: No, we still continue to see people wanting at least 10 years, some even more than that. So if anything, tenure will be increasing, particularly if you're going to bring your own generation, you really need a longer tenured contract in order to drive your own cost down. So we're seeing longer contracts, not shorter ones, Ryan.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And anything around inflation provisions? Are they becoming more standardized around some of the other commercial terms embedded in these contracts?
Lawrence Coben: I mean we are -- most of the contracts are going to be allowing us to pass through and allow us to keep our margins relatively fixed kind of across the board for a variety of factors.
Operator: Our final question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.
Andrew Weisel: First question on buybacks. I see that you're guiding to a moderation in next year to $1 billion. I think you previously alluded to that. Forgive me, I'm still a bit new to the story. Is that a function of LS Power and TEF CapEx, which is sort of onetime in nature? Or should we think of the $1 billion as a good run rate going forward? I can do the math, $3 billion through 2028 kind of implies that. But how are you thinking about this longer term?
Bruce Chung: Yes. It's really just staying consistent with what we had indicated when we announced the LS Power transaction, Andrew. We had indicated buybacks of $1 billion per year until we get through our deleveraging. And so that's all -- we just wanted to keep it consistent, recognizing that we were going to be updating capital allocation once we close.
Andrew Weisel: Okay. That makes sense. And similarly, on that last point there, you said that you'll update all the financials when LS Power closes. Does that mean like an 8-K or press release as soon as it closes? Or are you talking about the 4Q update in February?
Bruce Chung: I think it's really just going to be dependent on when we actually close and how that timing lines up with when we might otherwise regularly report earnings, fourth quarter earnings. And so we'll assess based on where things are lining up with respect to close to figure out what the best way to communicate with the investment community will be.
Andrew Weisel: Okay. That makes sense. And one last one. You covered a lot of good details, so this is kind of a nuanced one, but I'm seeing some headlines that potential sale of the Gladstone asset in Australia. A lot of people might not even remember that you have that. But how are you thinking about that asset? And could there be value there?
Bruce Chung: Look, I mean, we don't -- to the extent that there is value, it's really more -- it's going to be nominal at best. I wouldn't necessarily think of that as being a particularly significant driver. And if anything, it's really more to just continue to simplify our portfolio and streamline our operations.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn it back to Larry Coben for closing remarks.
Lawrence Coben: I want to thank you all for taking the time to listen and for your interest in NRG. I have never been more excited about our prospects as we are today, and I look forward to seeing you all on road shows and wherever so that we can discuss them in more detail. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

Original transcript:
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the NRG Energy, Inc. Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Brendan Mulhern, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brendan Mulhern: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to NRG Energy's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This morning's call is being broadcast live over the phone and via webcast. The webcast presentation and earnings release can be located in the Investors section of our website at www.nrg.com under Presentations and Webcast. Please note that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements, which are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. Actual results may differ materially. We urge everyone to review the safe harbor in today's presentation as well as the risk factors in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of future events, except as required by law. In addition, we will refer to both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please refer to today's presentation and earnings release. With that, I will now turn it over to Larry Coben, NRG's Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Lawrence Coben: Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your continued interest in NRG. I'm joined today by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our management team are also on the line and available to answer questions. Let's start with the key messages on Slide 4. Strong performance across all areas of the business led us to raise 2025 financial guidance by $100 million in late September. This is the third consecutive year we have increased our full year outlook. And today, we are reaffirming that higher range. We are also introducing 2026 guidance that aligns with our long-term growth targets. This represents NRG's stand-alone outlook and excludes any contribution from the LS Power acquisition. We will provide updated guidance that includes LS Power around the time of closing. We expanded our data center power agreements this quarter, bringing total contracted capacity to 445 megawatts. We also rapidly grew our pipeline of potential projects under joint development and letters of intent to 5.4 gigawatts. Together, these actions build on the agreement announced in August and reflect rapidly growing momentum and validation of our data center strategy. The LS Power acquisition remains on track. Financings were executed in September on favorable terms. All regulatory filings have been submitted, and we expect to close in the first quarter of 2026. Turning to Slide 5. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter was 32% higher than the same period last year, and adjusted EBITDA reached the highest quarterly level in company history. I'd like to pause to congratulate all 18,000 of our employees for that achievement. Our results reflect strong performance across both Energy and Smart Home. In Energy, supply optimization and disciplined commercial execution drove margin improvement across both our home and C&I businesses. In Smart Home, growth was supported by expanding our customer base, record retention and continued momentum in our home virtual power plant initiative. We also delivered top decile safety performance and completed the loan agreement for our second Texas Energy Fund project. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS is 36% higher than last year, reflecting strong performance across all parts of the business as well as continued cost discipline. These results keep us firmly on track to achieve our raised full year 2025 guidance ranges. On the right side of the slide, we are introducing 2026 guidance on a stand-alone basis. This serves as an interim view ahead of a full update after the LS Power acquisition closes when we will provide guidance for the combined company. Moving to Slide 6 for an update on market conditions. ERCOT experienced a mild summer with moderate pricing and strong growth in overall power use. Total consumption across Texas has increased nearly 30% over the past 5 years, driven by residential, commercial and industrial demand as electrification and onshoring of manufacturing accelerate. Data center development usage remains early with ramp schedules expected to add meaningful capacity over the next several years. Looking ahead, power demand is projected to outpace new supply, keeping the market structurally tight and reinforcing the need for reliable, dispatchable generation. Policymakers are responding through initiatives such as Senate Bill 6 in Texas and similar efforts in other regions focused on affordability, additionality and reliability. We are encouraged by the focus and progress being made to strengthen ERCOT and other competitive markets across the country. In this environment, NRG is expanding its portfolio of reliable and flexible capacity. Through the LS Power and Rockland acquisitions, the Texas Energy Fund projects and our home virtual power plant, we are adding 15 gigawatts of natural gas and 7 gigawatts of virtual power plant capacity. We also see about 6 gigawatts of additional opportunities through the GE Vernova partnership and our final TEF project that is still under review. Together, these actions strengthen our platform and position NRG to meet rising customer demand and support large load growth, including data centers across ERCOT, PJM and other key markets. Turning to Slide 7. We expanded our data center customer portfolio through 150 megawatts of new premium long-term power agreements, bringing total contracted capacity to 445 megawatts across ERCOT and PJM. This builds on the framework announced last quarter with the same customer. These sites located in Maryland and Illinois support edge data center development with access to high-capacity fiber and proximity to major U.S. cities. These projects will be built in PJM with operations beginning in 2028 and ramping through 2032. This agreement was signed above the midpoint of our prior $70 to $90 per megawatt hour target range. Given continued strength in customer demand and higher forward power curves, we are raising our target for new long-term data center agreements to above $80 per megawatt hour. This reflects sustained pricing improvement and NRG's leadership in providing reliable long-term power solutions for large load customers. We are advancing numerous additional opportunities, including up to 5.4 gigawatts of new capacity for data centers through 2032 under our GE Vernova and Kiewit partnership, supporting the principle of additionality. Since last quarter, signed letters of intent have increased 35%, underscoring customer engagement from multiple hyperscalers and data center developers as well as growing demand for new development. We also see several additional gigawatts of potential projects across our broader pipeline. As markets evolve to bring your own generation models, NRG is leading the next phase of data center growth. Turning to Slide 8. The LS Power acquisition remains firmly on track for a first quarter 2026 close. It strengthens our platform, broadens our earnings base and extends our reach across key competitive markets. It reinforces our position as one of the largest competitive generators in the country and increases our leverage to long-term demand growth. At announcement, the acquisition was immediately accretive across all key metrics, reflecting portfolio quality and an attractive purchase multiple. We also unveiled a 14% EPS CAGR through 2029, which does not -- I repeat, does not include any contribution from data centers and reflects pricing assumptions that are below current market levels. These factors, along with other upside opportunities underscore the significant potential ahead. Since announcement, incremental benefits, including 100% bonus depreciation have further enhanced the economics. All required filings have been submitted and financing was completed on terms better than originally projected. The transaction positions NRG for stronger long-term growth, greater scale and enhanced value creation as we bring the 2 platforms together. With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce for the financial review.
Bruce Chung: Thank you, Larry. Beginning with Slide 10, NRG delivered strong financial and operational performance in the third quarter with $2.78 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.205 billion in adjusted EBITDA, representing a 32% and 14% increase from the same quarter of 2024, respectively. Adjusted net income was $537 million and free cash flow before growth was $828 million. Through the first 3 quarters of 2025, NRG delivered $7.17 of adjusted earnings per share and over $3.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a year-over-year increase of 36% and 12%, respectively. Our exceptional quarterly and year-to-date financial performance reflects continued execution in all of our businesses, driven primarily by a mix of expanded margins, favorable weather and excellent commercial and operational execution. Our Texas segment delivered third quarter and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $807 million and $1.618 billion, respectively, representing an improvement of 38% and 29% from the same periods in 2024. These results were driven by margin expansion across our operations in the region with lower realized supply costs and excellent optimization despite low summer volatility. The East segment contributed adjusted EBITDA of $107 million in the third quarter and $680 million through the first 3 quarters of 2025. These results reflect a modest decline from the same period of 2024, primarily driven by the net impact of higher supply costs throughout the region, partially offset by increased capacity revenues at our plants and favorable weather in the first quarter, which benefited our natural gas business. Our West Services Other segment had adjusted EBITDA of $19 million in the third quarter and $139 million for the first 3 quarters of 2025. The segment realized higher retail power margins, which were offset by the absence of earnings from the sale of our Airtron business in 2024 and the lease expiration at the Cottonwood facility in May 2025 when compared to the same period of the prior year. Our Smart Home business posted another impressive quarter and executed brilliantly through the key summer selling season, achieving adjusted EBITDA of $272 million in the third quarter and $803 million through the first 3 quarters of 2025. The segment continues to see record new customer adds and retention rates as well as expanded net service margins. Our consolidated free cash flow before growth was $828 million for the quarter and $2.035 billion for the first 3 quarters of 2025. Year-to-date free cash flow before growth exceeded the same period in 2024 by $597 million or 42%. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by the higher year-to-date adjusted EBITDA, favorable working capital timing and receipt of the remaining insurance proceeds from our Paris Unit B claims. We expect some of the year-over-year favorability to moderate as working capital timing normalizes in the first -- in the fourth quarter and as we continue to invest in our plants through our scheduled maintenance program. Looking to the remainder of 2025, we are reaffirming the increased financial guidance we announced last month with ranges of $7.55 to $8.15 for adjusted EPS $3.875 billion to $4.025 billion for adjusted EBITDA and $2.1 billion to $2.25 billion for free cash flow before growth. Moving to Slide 11 for updates to our capital allocation for the remainder of 2025. This has been updated to reflect the new midpoint of our raised free cash flow before growth guidance target, setting the total capital available for allocation in 2025 at $2.7 billion. Note that this slide excludes proceeds received from the $4.9 billion of new debt raised in October, most of which will be allocated to fund the cash portion of the pending LS Power transaction. A few other updates from what I shared in our second quarter call are denoted in light blue. Starting with an update to liability management. The $52 million increase primarily reflects transaction costs and financing fees associated with the LS Power transaction. Integration costs increased by $20 million due to a shift in spend from 2024 to 2025. The net total remained largely consistent with our communicated expectation between the 2 years. We remain on track to execute the full $1.3 billion in share repurchases slated in 2025. Through October 31, we have executed $1.084 billion in share repurchases or nearly 85% of our planned annual total at a weighted average price of $125.35 and expect to complete the full amount of share repurchases by the end of the year. Other related activities increased due to higher tax withholdings related to equity compensation resulting from the increase in our share price. The increase in the revenue synergy growth plan reflects the strong customer growth our Smart Home segment has delivered through the year. Customer growth for the business was 9% year-over-year, well surpassing the targeted 5% to 6% net customer growth embedded in our growth plan. On other investments, we are showing a net $30 million inflow of capital related to our Texas new build program. As you may recall, the stipulated capital structure for projects under the Texas Energy Fund program is 60-40 debt to equity. In order to get our TDF projects to that target capital structure, the initial disbursement under the loan took into account previously spent development costs. Given that catch-up mechanism under the loan, the disbursements we received in 2025 exceeded the amount of capital we expect to spend on the projects, therefore, resulting in a net inflow of capital for the year. Finally, we are on track to finish the year with $158 million of unallocated capital, which we currently plan to roll over into 2026 and deploy as part of our 2026 capital allocation plan. Turning to the next slide. We are initiating our 2026 NRG stand-alone financial guidance at ranges of $3.925 billion to $4.175 billion for adjusted EBITDA, representing a midpoint of $4.05 billion and free cash flow before growth of $1.975 billion to $2.225 billion, representing a midpoint of $2.1 billion. We are not providing stand-alone EPS guidance as we acknowledge that EPS will change materially with the closing of the LS Power transaction due to associated accounting adjustments, pro forma capital allocation and other matters impacting any per share financial metrics. As you can see on the slide, we have included the same adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before growth for the acquisition, which we provided when we originally announced the transaction in May. This, combined with the 2026 NRG stand-alone guidance that we are initiating today should remind people of the pro forma company's earnings profile. We will provide an updated pro forma view once the transaction is closed, which we -- which will include updates to items like energy and capacity prices, accelerated depreciation benefits and pro forma capital allocation, among others. On the bottom of the page, we have provided walks from the midpoint of our original 2025 guidance to the midpoint of our new 2026 guidance on a stand-alone NRG basis. For adjusted EBITDA, the net $200 million increase year-over-year is primarily driven by the addition of the Rockland assets acquired earlier in the year, the impact of higher power pricing in our Texas segment and the continued execution of our existing $750 million growth plan. The impact of higher power pricing in Texas that we are showing is consistent with the sensitivities we have provided in our previous earnings materials and reflect an increase in around-the-clock pricing from the $47 we previously used to $53 per megawatt hour, which reflects Texas pricing at the end of July. The sum total of these year-over-year increases is slightly offset by other minor drivers such as regulatory developments negatively impacting the Maryland and New York competitive retail markets and tariff impacts on our businesses. On free cash flow before growth, we are -- we expect strong year-over-year growth from core operations amounting to $145 million, comprised of the previously discussed EBITDA growth, partially offset by the continued investment in our generation fleet. After taking into account higher cash interest and taxes, we forecast free cash flow before growth to be flat year-over-year. The higher cash interest is largely driven by refinancing of very low-cost debt that was issued when the Fed funds rate hovered near 0%. The increase in cash taxes primarily relates to fewer federal tax credits available to offset income than in prior years. Just to reiterate, we will provide a more detailed update on pro forma financial metrics once we close the acquisition. I look forward to sharing that update with you soon. Moving to Slide 13 for a brief discussion on 2026 NRG stand-alone capital allocation. The key takeaway here is that we remain committed to our return of capital program through share repurchases of $1 billion and our planned 7% to 9% annualized growth of the common dividend per share. This is the case both on a stand-alone and pro forma basis. I'm also pleased to share that our Board has approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization to be executed through 2028. As you can imagine, certain elements of this chart, such as the starting point for excess cash and liability management will look very different after we close the acquisition. As such, I do not intend to go further into detail on this slide. We will provide a fulsome update on capital allocation alongside our key financial metrics once we close on the LS Assets acquisition. In closing, NRG has delivered outstanding financial and operational results through the first 3 quarters of this year, and we are poised to finish the year on a high note. The stand-alone 2026 financial guidance and capital allocation outlook I have shared today further demonstrates the solid growth and continued performance of our stand-alone base business. I look forward to providing you updated and detailed guidance for 2026 that includes the assets we are acquiring from LS Power following the closing of the transaction. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry.
Lawrence Coben: Thank you, Bruce. Turning to Slide 15. 2025 has been an outstanding year across every part of our business, and our outlook continues to improve. Our near-term focus is on completing the LS Power acquisition and providing you with an updated long-term outlook following the close. We also continue expanding our data center portfolio, advancing our Texas energy projects, including completing the construction of the T.H. Wharton project and returning at least $1.3 billion to shareholders. These priorities reflect a disciplined approach to growth and capital allocation as we position NRG for 2026 and beyond, continuing to build a company defined by consistent execution and accelerating value creation. With that, we'll now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Wells Fargo.
Lawrence Coben: Welcome back to the workforce.
Shahriar Pourreza: I'm ready to go back to Garden to be honest.
Lawrence Coben: I want to see the flowers.
Shahriar Pourreza: So Larry, just do you think '26 is kind of that year you're going to be able to announce a data center agreement that includes new development as part of your GEV, Kiewit partnership?
Lawrence Coben: Yes.
Shahriar Pourreza: You tongue tied me again.
Lawrence Coben: Well, you remember the last time I gave you a one-word answer, it showed up. So I'm giving you a one-word answer.
Shahriar Pourreza: Any sense around timing next year? Are we thinking back half or earlier part of the year?
Lawrence Coben: It's hard to tell, Shar. As my good friend, Max said yesterday, these are complex, but super excited by the process and never been more sure.
Shahriar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, just maybe share a little bit more about sort of the announced data center deals, how they kind of compare to those announced by your peers. So a little bit more color around the margins given other peer deals that come with generation linkages.
Lawrence Coben: Yes. We put a little slide in the appendix, which kind of talks about margin and pricing. This is very similar to the one that we announced last quarter, just locationally different. Premium margin as a result of different things go into getting our premium margin on any deal, including land, including our commercial acumen. I mean I really need to say we have the best commercial team in the business at both gas and electricity, being able to really meet customer needs in a flexible way, all of those lead to the margin that you see on that appendix chart.
Operator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Let's -- let me jump back to the -- let me ask the same question that our buddy just asked a second ago in a different way. Look, as far as GEV goes in this Kiewit partnership, do you have a certain time frame that you need to move some of this equipment, use it or lose it, if you will? Can you speak to that a little bit? Because I think that's probably an important nuance to speak to when you talk about your confidence and the time lines under which you're operating to execute on this.
Lawrence Coben: Look, Julien, we haven't disclosed any time lines, but we're -- I'm very confident that we're going to meet all of the time lines that are required under that agreement. But what you're really trying to do, Julien, and I know is pin me to a month, and I'm not going to let you do that.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. You know what we're all trying. I mean start too.
Lawrence Coben: [indiscernible] Well done, but...
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Not quite there. All right. I got it. Well, let me ask it this way. As far as it goes with the build your own power, BYOP as we're calling it, right, like there's clearly been an evolution in the marketplace. When you think about the scope of what's possible here, again, I know folks have been looking at co-located opportunities in the last couple of years, but now we firmly shifted. How meaningful, right? We've seen a few announcements here with a couple of hundred megawatts here, a couple of hundred megawatts this quarter. I mean when you say you're going to deliver updates next year, can you speak to BYOP and the scale of what's at hand here in terms of really building out contracted jet?
Lawrence Coben: Sure. Look, just starting with the GEV, Kiewit deal, Julien, that's 5.4 gigs. So that's a good place to start from. I mean there are some things that could be added to that in a variety of ways that we're looking at. But I think if we brought even 5.4 gigs to the table, you would be and everyone would be super happy from us. So I mean, the scale -- I mean, that's kind of the scale that we're focused on right now, but we are looking at opportunities to see how we can make that even greater.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. And then let me just shift this slightly. When you think about the focus here, I mean, a lot of conversation has been around your portfolio in Texas and ERCOT specifically. Can you speak a little bit more broadly? Obviously, you guys have Illinois site, PJM is talking increasingly about bringing new assets to fore. Illinois just passed legislation in recent weeks. For instance, is there an opportunity in the PJM portfolio to both add gen -- add gas and storage specifically and perhaps tap into some of these developments that have been recently put to kind of quell the state's needs for new capacity?
Lawrence Coben: Absolutely, Julien. And we are working hard on that, and we'll really accelerate those efforts, of course, once LS closes because until we own the generation assets there, that will really fault us into being a significant player, but there's no grass growing under our feet there in the meantime.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. And Illinois legislation, is there something for you guys to do there specifically to ask that more pointedly?
Lawrence Coben: I don't think the legislation is really going to be the driver of this, Julien. So -- but as you know, we do have sites in Illinois. So...
Operator: Our next question comes from Agnie Storozynski with Seaport.
Agnieszka Storozynski: So first of all -- now I see the slide showing the sensitivity of your gross margin to changes in forward power curves. I mean we've had finally the move in curves we had waited for. And so I'm just wondering if anything has changed there? Are you waiting to update it for your enlarged portfolio? Any comments?
Lawrence Coben: Agnie, you just hit the nail on the head. We are waiting to update it for our enlarged portfolio.
Agnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And you're not going to give me any sense how -- especially the PJM price is moving, how they are impacting the pro forma EBITDA of the company for now?
Lawrence Coben: Not at this stage. Well, certainly, we will provide, obviously, a very fulsome update soon after we close on the transaction.
Agnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then the second thing is, so we've had some companies, new power companies or pretending to be new power companies that have aspirations to build gas plants without any prior expertise in power. So I mean, it is surprising that they could be ahead of you in the pecking order. It's not for the fact that you guys actually have sites, have equipment, know how to hedge gas, et cetera. So is it that they just talk more about their opportunities versus you guys? Or do you still feel like you have a head start over those companies?
Lawrence Coben: Agnie, I'm convinced that we're in a great position to do what I was describing. We had this a long time, so of you, there's a lot of announcements -- when I actually see to use Sam Altman's new term electrons flowing, then I will actually believe that they're real or you'll see steel in the ground. But we're not one -- we tell you what we've done. We don't tell you what we're going to do, and that's kind of my philosophy in all this. So there's going to be a lot of announcements because a lot of people think they're data center and power developers. Some of those are probably real, but I'm very, very comfortable with where we sit in the pecking order, both with respect to building power plants and with respect to hyperscalers.
Agnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then one more. I mean, we are still seeing a lot of assets, private assets being offered to companies like you, hopefully. You do have a large pending acquisition. And I'm just wondering if you would still have interest in single asset transactions before the LS Power transaction closes.
Lawrence Coben: We look at everything. And if there's something that's economically attractive, that's a great fit for our portfolio, we would be interested. We don't feel we need to add any additional capacity given the LS acquisition, the Rockford acquisition and the TEF projects, but we are always opportunistic when these things are out there.
Agnieszka Storozynski: And then lastly, Bruce, you mentioned the free cash flow guidance for '26 and the fact that you're sort of running out of the tax shield. I mean, the LS Power transaction brings the tax shield, right? So there would be presumably an improvement sort of free cash flow generation of the current business on the back of that transaction. Is that fair?
Bruce Chung: Yes, I think that's generally a fair statement, Agnie. The one thing that I'll just clarify for you is that uptick in cash tax that we talk about on a stand-alone basis isn't necessarily related to our NOLs disappearing. It's really more about certain tax credits that we had from our days when we owned renewable assets that eventually expired. And so regardless of the LS transaction, we're still going to have a very sizable NOL position. But clearly, the LS transaction is going to give us even more, which should inure to a cash flow benefit.
Operator: Next question comes from James West with Melius Research.
James West: Larry, in your prepared comments, both at the beginning and the end, I think you made it very clear that you guys are not just standing still waiting to close OS, but you've got a lot of other things going on. If you were to kind of rank order what you're most excited about outside of that transaction, what would you say are the top kind of 1, 2, 3 other things or items that you're waiting to hopefully announce to us in the near term?
Lawrence Coben: I'm going to do them in no particular order because otherwise, that's like picking favorites among your kids.
James West: Understood.
Lawrence Coben: I mean we have -- both on the C&I and on the retail side and energy and in Smart, we have a lot of -- people have kind of lost sight of. We have a very exciting growth plan where we're killing it. Second, our residential VPP excites me tremendously. And after LS close, I'm also even more excited about our demand response potential. So I look at all of those things. And I guess the fourth thing I would say is bringing our first project online and making progress on the other 2. So there's a lot going on here that we don't -- we haven't even begun to put into our numbers. And -- so even if there were no -- I just -- as a reminder, even if there were no data centers at all and no changes in power prices, we're still showing a 14% CAGR, and we still have a double-digit free cash flow discount rate. So I'm sorry, I'm super excited about that. I don't know where I could get in the market such as -- with not much downside, those kind of numbers, leaving out all the other great things that we're doing. So I am as bullish as I've ever been.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays.
Nicholas Campanella: Maybe I could just follow up on the BYOP combo, just your conversation with policymakers at the states you operate in, how does that look in terms of BYOP? How have the customer conversations evolved over the last 6 months? And is it a fair assumption that all deals going forward just need some type of additionality in this space now? Or how would you kind of frame that?
Lawrence Coben: I mean I don't -- speaking to all deals is hard, but it starts with the Secretary of Energy, who's been very, very explicit on this. And I think as regulators more and more look at the affordability question and how to distribute the cost of this new power, the simplest way to do it and the fairest way to do it, I think, is probably bring your own gen. Now whether that's megawatt hour per megawatt hour or 75% or 50% or some other measure, I think, remains to be seen. But I think every policymaker is looking at this for 2 reasons. One is the affordability factor and two is everyone knows they need new power. Everyone knows they need new infrastructure. So to the extent if you're the governor of, say, New Jersey or Pennsylvania or somewhere like that, you would rather spread that cost across Amazon or Meta or Googles or Microsoft's billions of customers around the world rather than your own rate payers. So this is a trend that we started talking about a year ago and prepared for it with our GEV and Kiewit joint venture, and it's now really coming home to roost and accelerating in the last few months.
Nicholas Campanella: Definitely recognize that. Maybe just with PJM being a more important jurisdiction pro forma of this LS Power deal. Can you talk about the capacity auction and just the prospects and timing for the collar to potentially be extended or just what you're advocating for with stakeholders, where you think the industry is heading and ultimately, what outcome you think would be good for the industry?
Unknown Executive: It's Rob. Look, nothing's changed since the last auction as far as supply and demand. So I would expect that, that means that we're going to price at the top of that cap and collar. The -- as far as long term goes, they're looking at lots of different ways to solve the equation. Ultimately, we -- everybody is generally concerned about reliability and they're concerned about things like affordability. But in order to get reliability, you have to have price signals. And so the market has to reflect something for something to get built. As far as the collar being extended, we were supportive of the collar last time. I could see it being extended again because it provides certainty for everyone in the market. Whether or not the top end of that collar is at the right place, that's yet to be determined.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.
Carly Davenport: Larry, you mentioned before your excitement about the resi VPP program and the pilot there. I guess, any updates on how that's tracking in terms of uptake? And is that something that we should expect to see sort of regular updates on in subsequent calls?
Lawrence Coben: Yes. I'm going to kick that over to Brad.
Unknown Executive: Thank you. Yes. No, we've been very pleased with the progress from VPP. So as you're aware, we did raise guidance earlier this year for the balance of '25. So we went from 20 megawatts to 150, and we remain on track for our 1 gig by year-end. We received a lot of...[indiscernible] We received a lot of great feedback from customers about the value and the experience of our offering. So we're really excited about that, and we're actually installing more customers than anticipated. And I think as we had shared in our last earnings, we're actually seeing the upgrade of additional equipment kind of 2x our expectations. But apart from that, we're also piloting some additional new home automation offerings which not only deliver the demand response, but will also help reduce home energy consumption, which will enable us to offer customers home energy savings. So as affordability and grid capacity become more critical, energy will really have the only solution to meet those needs to be able to reduce energy consumption and save customers money. So we're really excited about piloting that, not just in Texas, but we will also be taking that out to the East early next year.
Carly Davenport: Great. Okay. That's super helpful. And then maybe just on the data center pipeline, you have one agreement with first delivery in '26, another in '28. I guess, is there any trends that you're seeing in terms of when customers are looking to be energized on these fields?
Lawrence Coben: I mean I think they're looking to be energized as quickly as possible, but there are some bottlenecks, as you know, with interconnection and things of that nature as well as if you do really need to bring your own power plant, obviously, that doesn't occur in a day. So I think customers are -- would love to start ramping yesterday, and they're doing what they can to do that. But I think if I look at the graph from now through 2031, there's more and more power coming on ramping each of those years. So I don't think anybody comes to the table thinking, well, we really want to start in 2033, but I think they're also realistic about building their own businesses and the constraints that exist.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.
David Arcaro: When you say that you're -- let's see, on the data center power agreements, increasing your kind of expectations for pricing to now be above $80 a megawatt hour. What's that reflecting? Is that a reflection of where market prices have gone? And just thinking about the upper end of your prior $70 to $90 range, like does that upper end go up as well? Kind of curious just like would you be repricing like bring your own power type deals also upward?
Lawrence Coben: I think everything is pricing upward as a result of increasing demand. If you look at the capital expenditure announcements by the hyperscalers, they continue to rapidly increase across the board. I think it's a recognition from people of the commercial -- of our rather unique ability commercially to supply them in ways that they want to be supplied and to bring new power to the table and just really heightened interest from multiple hyperscalers and developers in a very accelerating fashion, just kind of using the basic laws of supply and demand. So all of those are factors that led us to raise this really to kind of take the top of the range and raise the bottom of the range.
David Arcaro: Got it. Okay. Great. That's helpful. Then separately, I was just wondering if you could comment on the retail competitive backdrop, retail -- your outlook for retail margins from here? Can they remain strong looking out at your forecast?
Unknown Executive: Yes. We have -- this is Brad. We continue to see strong margins in Texas. And we have had -- primarily because it's a competitive marketplace. And so as prices have gone up, we've been able to maintain those margins. As I mentioned earlier, we are looking at solutions to help give some customers relief in terms of helping reduce energy consumption. As we know, affordability will be a challenge as everyone does raise prices. In the East, a little bit different dynamic when we're up against the price to compare. And so that one, we have seen a little bit of margin erosion that we are managing very closely. But as I mentioned earlier, being able to bring an integrated value proposition to the consumer that gets beyond competing for price per kilowatt hour and give them a solution that actually brings their energy consumption down and give them home protection and home automation in the home. We believe that's a solution that we will be able to scale and slightly change the conversation. So a little bit different dynamic, as you know, between the East and what we see in Texas.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.
Ryan Levine: Hoping to follow up on the Smart Home business. Good to see the 9% annual year-over-year growth there. What are you assuming for '26 stand-alone business contribution for Smart Home growth? And how do you see that trend evolving into your longer-term outlook?
Lawrence Coben: Yes. In terms of customer counts, we're assuming something very similar to what we saw this year. We've seen really strong growth across really all of our channels of distribution. We're also launching more of a good, better, best. Historically, Vivint has been pushing the higher-end systems, but we're able to, as I mentioned earlier, offer a much more affordable entry-level offering that not only gives customers some security protection, but also that energy management savings that I touched on. So with the additional kind of good, better, best, it opens up new channels of distribution. And so we expect really strong growth in '26 as well.
Bruce Chung: Ryan, I just want to remind when we announced that $750 million growth plan, we had indicated Smart Home net customer growth to be in that 5% to 6% range. And so I think when Brad alludes to the customer growth that we're assuming for '26, it's still going to be pretty consistent with that original growth plan -- probably higher.
Ryan Levine: And then in terms of the hyperscaler data center conversations, I appreciate the additional guidance around pricing and momentum. But in terms of duration of the contracts, are you seeing any change there around the tenor of contracts that the customers are looking for as demand has continued to accelerate?
Lawrence Coben: No, we still continue to see people wanting at least 10 years, some even more than that. So if anything, tenure will be increasing, particularly if you're going to bring your own generation, you really need a longer tenured contract in order to drive your own cost down. So we're seeing longer contracts, not shorter ones, Ryan.
Ryan Levine: Okay. And anything around inflation provisions? Are they becoming more standardized around some of the other commercial terms embedded in these contracts?
Lawrence Coben: I mean we are -- most of the contracts are going to be allowing us to pass through and allow us to keep our margins relatively fixed kind of across the board for a variety of factors.
Operator: Our final question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.
Andrew Weisel: First question on buybacks. I see that you're guiding to a moderation in next year to $1 billion. I think you previously alluded to that. Forgive me, I'm still a bit new to the story. Is that a function of LS Power and TEF CapEx, which is sort of onetime in nature? Or should we think of the $1 billion as a good run rate going forward? I can do the math, $3 billion through 2028 kind of implies that. But how are you thinking about this longer term?
Bruce Chung: Yes. It's really just staying consistent with what we had indicated when we announced the LS Power transaction, Andrew. We had indicated buybacks of $1 billion per year until we get through our deleveraging. And so that's all -- we just wanted to keep it consistent, recognizing that we were going to be updating capital allocation once we close.
Andrew Weisel: Okay. That makes sense. And similarly, on that last point there, you said that you'll update all the financials when LS Power closes. Does that mean like an 8-K or press release as soon as it closes? Or are you talking about the 4Q update in February?
Bruce Chung: I think it's really just going to be dependent on when we actually close and how that timing lines up with when we might otherwise regularly report earnings, fourth quarter earnings. And so we'll assess based on where things are lining up with respect to close to figure out what the best way to communicate with the investment community will be.
Andrew Weisel: Okay. That makes sense. And one last one. You covered a lot of good details, so this is kind of a nuanced one, but I'm seeing some headlines that potential sale of the Gladstone asset in Australia. A lot of people might not even remember that you have that. But how are you thinking about that asset? And could there be value there?
Bruce Chung: Look, I mean, we don't -- to the extent that there is value, it's really more -- it's going to be nominal at best. I wouldn't necessarily think of that as being a particularly significant driver. And if anything, it's really more to just continue to simplify our portfolio and streamline our operations.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn it back to Larry Coben for closing remarks.
Lawrence Coben: I want to thank you all for taking the time to listen and for your interest in NRG. I have never been more excited about our prospects as we are today, and I look forward to seeing you all on road shows and wherever so that we can discuss them in more detail. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.

Supported outcomes (where management explicitly compared to history and numbers confirm)

- Management claim: Q3 adjusted EBITDA reached the highest quarterly level in company history.
  • Support: Q3 2025 adjusted EBITDA = $1.205B vs Q3 2024 = $1.055B; the Q3 2025 figure is higher and supports the "highest quarterly level" statement.

- Management claim: Q3 adjusted EPS was substantially higher year‑over‑year (management noted 32%).
  • Support: Q3 2025 adjusted EPS = $2.78 vs Q3 2024 = $1.90 — the dollar change confirms meaningful YoY EPS improvement and supports management’s claim of material EPS growth.

- Management claim: Q3 adjusted net income and FCFbG improved year‑over‑year.
  • Support: Adjusted net income Q3 2025 = $537M vs Q3 2024 = $393M (higher); FCFbG Q3 2025 = $828M vs Q3 2024 = $815M (slightly higher). These figures confirm improved bottom‑line cash and profit metrics.

- Management claim: Year‑to‑date improvements and larger repurchases.
  • Support: YTD / first 3 quarters 2025 adjusted EBITDA > $3.2B and adjusted EPS YTD = $7.17; share repurchases through Oct 31, 2025 = $1.084B vs $544M in 2024 — numbers confirm stronger YTD bottom‑line performance and more aggressive capital return.

Summary (bottom‑line focus)
- Across key bottom‑line metrics (adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, FCFbG, and share repurchases), 2025‑Q3 results are generally higher than 2024‑Q3 comparables — often materially (notably adjusted EBITDA, net income, EPS, and repurchases). The 2025 guidance raise ($100M) is an improvement but smaller than the prior year’s late‑year raise ($175M). Management’s stated historical comparisons are supported by the reported numbers.

Historical‑Calls note:
1) Validate past guidance (met / beat / missed)

- Adjusted EPS guidance for 2025 (2024-Q3): historical: $7.25 → Status in 2025‑Q3: Beat. Current 2025 guidance range is $7.55 to $8.15 (2025-Q3), i.e., above the prior $7.25 level.

- Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025 (2024-Q3): historical: $3.85 billion → Status in 2025‑Q3: Beat. Current 2025 guidance range is $3.875 billion to $4.025 billion (2025-Q3), i.e., above the prior $3.85B.

- Free cash flow before growth (FCFbG) guidance for 2025 (2024-Q3): historical: $2.1 billion → Status in 2025‑Q3: Beat. Current 2025 guidance is $2.1 billion to $2.25 billion (2025-Q3); midpoint ($2.175B) is above the prior $2.1B and the upper end is higher.

- Long-term EPS CAGR target through 2029 (2024-Q3): historical: at least 10% → Status in 2025‑Q3: Beat. Management unveiled a 14% EPS CAGR through 2029 (2025-Q3).

- Virtual power plant (VPP) capacity goal (2024‑Q3): historical: 1 gigawatt target (by plan) → Status in 2025‑Q3: Beat (ahead). Management states they remain on track for 1 gigawatt by year-end (2025), i.e., achieving the 1 GW target earlier than the prior multi-year baseline.

- Dispatchable VPP capacity by 2030 (2024‑Q3): historical: 650 megawatts target → Status in 2025‑Q3: Beat (ahead). Current statements target 1 GW by year-end, exceeding the earlier 650 MW goal.

- Share repurchase authorization increase (2024‑Q3): historical: $1 billion increase announced → Status in 2025‑Q3: Beat. As of 2025‑Q3 management reports a new Board-approved $3 billion repurchase authorization through 2028.

- Long-term data center agreements expansion (2025‑Q2): historical: target expanding from 295 MW to 1,000 MW → Status in 2025‑Q3: Missed (to date). Current contracted capacity reported is 445 MW (after adding 150 MW), which is below the 1,000 MW expansion target as of this quarter.

- LS Power acquisition capacity (2025‑Q1): historical: cited 13 GW natural gas + 6 GW C&I VPP → Status in 2025‑Q3: Beat. Current statements describe adding 15 GW of natural gas and 7 GW of VPP capacity as part of capacity additions underway.

Peers note:
English

- Fact 3 — 2026 Guidance Introduction:
  - NRG: Introduced 2026 guidance that "aligns with our long-term growth targets."
  - How it differs: NRG frames 2026 guidance as explicitly aligned to multi‑year targets rather than being a cautious near‑term posture. Peers show a mix — some are cautious about 2026 guidance (SJM: "remain cautious in our fiscal year 2026 guidance", 2025‑Q4) while others are raising or reaffirming near‑term guidance (EXPE: "Raising the full year guidance", 2025‑Q3; VTRS: "Reiterate guidance", 2025‑Q1). NRG’s stance is more growth‑oriented and confidence‑forward compared with peers that emphasized caution or simple reaffirmation.

- Fact 5 — Data Center Contracted Capacity (445 MW):
  - NRG: Reported 150 MW added this quarter, "bringing total contracted capacity to 445 megawatts."
  - How it differs: NRG reports contracted capacity measured in hundreds of megawatts, whereas peers in the energy/renewables space report backlog in tens of gigawatts (e.g., FSLR: "54.5 gigawatts" contracted backlog, 2025‑Q3). NRG’s disclosed book is therefore smaller in absolute scale compared with some large-scale project/backlog disclosures from peers.

- Fact 6 — Data Center Development Pipeline (5.4 GW):
  - NRG: Pipeline of projects/LOIs to 5.4 gigawatts.
  - How it differs: NRG’s pipeline (5.4 GW) is meaningful but smaller than the very large mid/late‑stage pipelines peers report (FSLR: "79.2 gigawatts" total pipeline of mid‑ to late‑stage opportunities, 2025‑Q3; AES: "Over 50 gigawatts" in development, 2023‑Q4). Peers emphasize much larger GW‑scale pipelines.

- Fact 8 — Q3 Adjusted EPS Growth (32% YoY):
  - NRG: Adjusted EPS for Q3 up 32% vs prior year.
  - How it differs: NRG is reporting strong double‑digit EPS growth (32%), while many peers reported more modest quarter‑to‑quarter or single‑digit moves (OTIS: "Grew approximately 1% or $0.01", 2024‑Q3; IQV: "Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 14.1% year‑over‑year" quoted as $2.84). NRG’s EPS acceleration is materially stronger than several peers’ comparables.

- Fact 9 — Q3 Adjusted EBITDA Level (highest quarterly level):
  - NRG: Adjusted EBITDA reached the highest quarterly level in company history.
  - How it differs: Peers also occasionally report record quarters (NCLH: "highest quarterly gross revenue and adjusted EBITDA recorded", 2024‑Q3), but NRG’s record is tied to energy segmentation and specific drivers (retail, Texas, Smart Home, data centers). The difference is thematic — NRG’s record is supported by commodity/contract and segment mix; some peers’ records are driven by demand in travel/consumer segments.

- Fact 10 — Year‑to‑Date Adjusted EPS Growth (36% YoY):
  - NRG: YTD adjusted EPS up 36% vs prior year.
  - How it differs: NRG’s YTD EPS growth is well above many peer YTD figures (FISV: "Year‑to‑date adjusted earnings per share $6.65", 2025‑Q3; SRE: "Year‑to‑date adjusted EPS $2.24", 2024‑Q2). The difference: NRG emphasizes outsized YoY EPS acceleration relative to several peers.

- Fact 17 — Capacity Additions from LS/Rockland/TEF/VPP (15 GW gas, 7 GW VPP):
  - NRG: "we are adding 15 gigawatts of natural gas and 7 gigawatts of virtual power plant capacity."
  - How it differs: NRG is citing very large add plans (22 GW total) anchored to specific programs/partnerships. Peers provided smaller near‑term construction cites (CEG: "1,000 megawatts or more added to the grid", 2024‑Q1) or multi‑GW construction capability (AES: "Add 3.6 gigawatts of new projects in 2024", 2023‑Q4). NRG’s programmatic GW additions are described at a larger program scale than some peers’ single‑year builds.

- Fact 18 — Additional Capacity Opportunities (~6 GW via partnerships/projects):
  - NRG: "about 6 gigawatts of additional opportunities through the GE Vernova partnership and our final TEF project."
  - How it differs: NRG quantifies partnership‑driven optionality (6 GW) explicitly. Peers describe opportunities more generically (IP: "Multiple opportunities for greenfield and brownfield investments", 2024‑Q3) or give different construction expectations (AES). NRG provides a concrete partnership‑linked GW figure, whereas peers often give higher‑level opportunity language.

- Fact 19 — New Data Center Agreements Signed (150 MW new):
  - NRG: "150 megawatts of new premium long‑term power agreements."
  - How it differs: NRG highlights a discrete 150 MW book add; peers often report backlog or contracted GW figures (FSLR: "54.5 gigawatts" backlog, 2025‑Q3) or revenue/backlog dollar momentum (GNRC: "Backlog doubled to over $300 million", 2025‑Q3). NRG’s per‑quarter deal flow is presented at MW scale versus peers’ GW/backlog framing.

- Fact 21 — Data Center Pricing Target (> $80/MWh):
  - NRG: Raising target for new long‑term data center agreements to above $80 per megawatt hour.
  - How it differs: NRG states an explicit $/MWh pricing target. Peers typically discuss growth rates or revenue rather than an explicit per‑MWh target (EME: "Expected growth high teens to mid‑20s" for the data center business, 2025‑Q3; STX: data center revenue "$2.1 billion", 2026‑Q1). NRG’s disclosure is more granular and price‑focused than many peer comments.

- Fact 22 — LOI Growth for Data Center Capacity (LOIs +35% QoQ):
  - NRG: "signed letters of intent have increased 35% since last quarter."
  - How it differs: NRG quantifies LOI growth quarter‑over‑quarter. Peers reference momentum and demand but often in revenue or pipeline terms (EME: "Momentum and demand in our markets", 2025‑Q2; SMCI: "Number of large‑scale data center customers increased", 2025‑Q4). NRG provides a precise LOI % increase rather than qualitative momentum language.

- Fact 26 — EPS CAGR Target Through 2029 (14%, excl. data centers):
  - NRG: Unveiled a 14% EPS CAGR through 2029, explicitly excluding data center contribution and noting conservative pricing assumptions.
  - How it differs: NRG’s 14% target is materially higher than many peers’ long‑term EPS CAGR guidance (SRE: "Projected long‑term EPS CAGR 7% to 9%", 2025‑Q1). NRG positions a more aggressive multi‑year EPS objective while noting it excludes potential upside.

- Fact 28 — Q3 2025 Adjusted EPS and EBITDA ($2.78 EPS; $1.205B EBITDA; +32% EPS, +14% EBITDA YoY):
  - NRG: Reported $2.78 adjusted EPS and $1.205 billion adjusted EBITDA.
  - How it differs: NRG’s Q3 shows both high EPS growth and >$1B EBITDA. Comparable large quarters exist (EXPE: Q3 adjusted EBITDA "$1.4 billion", 2025‑Q3), but many peers report smaller absolute EBITDA numbers. NRG’s result places it among peers with billion‑dollar EBITDA quarters.

- Fact 30 — YTD 2025 Adjusted EPS and EBITDA ($7.17 EPS; >$3.2B EBITDA; +36% and +12% YoY):
  - NRG: Through 3 quarters delivered $7.17 adj EPS and over $3.2B adj EBITDA.
  - How it differs: NRG’s YTD EPS/EBITDA growth is strong; peers’ YTD adjusted EBITDA references vary (VST: "Year‑to‑date ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA $2.227 billion", 2024‑Q2). NRG’s YTD scale is higher than some peers’ comparable YTD figures.

- Fact 31 — Texas Segment EBITDA Performance ($807M Q3; $1.618B YTD; +38% Q and +29% YTD):
  - NRG: Texas segment delivered outsized contributions and growth.
  - How it differs: NRG highlights a very large, high‑growth regional segment. Peer segment callouts often report different segment scales (DXCM: adjusted EBITDA examples like "$368.4 million" Q3, 2025‑Q3). NRG’s Texas segment is larger and shows stronger percentage improvements relative to many peers’ single‑segment figures.

- Fact 33 — East Segment EBITDA ($107M Q3; $680M YTD):
  - NRG: East segment contribution of $107M Q3 and $680M YTD.
  - How it differs: Compared with some peers’ segment EBITDA (e.g., DXCM Q3 adjusted EBITDA "$368.4 million", 2025‑Q3), NRG’s East segment is a mid‑scale contributor; NRG’s overall narrative highlights segmentation breadth (large Texas, meaningful Smart Home, smaller West/Other).

- Fact 34 — West/Services/Other Segment EBITDA ($19M Q3; $139M YTD):
  - NRG: Smaller contribution from West/Services/Other.
  - How it differs: Peers often report larger single‑segment EBITDA figures (TTD estimated Q3 adjusted EBITDA "$277 million", 2025‑Q2). NRG emphasizes that some segments are small and that consolidated performance is driven by specific large segments.

- Fact 36 — Smart Home EBITDA and Growth Drivers ($272M Q3; $803M YTD; record new customers and retention):
  - NRG: Attributes Smart Home growth to record new customer adds, retention and expanded net service margins.
  - How it differs: NRG points to operating KPIs (customer adds/retention) as the core driver of Smart Home EBITDA expansion. Peers discuss revenue growth broadly (EME: "Revenue growth in data centers almost double", 2025‑Q3). NRG ties profitability gains to customer metric improvements more explicitly than some peers.

- Fact 37 — Consolidated FCFbG YTD Growth ($828M Q; $2.035B YTD; +42% YoY):
  - NRG: Free cash flow before growth $828M for the quarter and $2.035B YTD, up 42% YoY.
  - How it differs: NRG reports very strong FCFbG growth YTD. Peers have varied FCFbG outcomes (VST: "adjusted free cash flow before growth of approximately $2.888 billion for 2024", 2024‑Q4; STZ: "Year‑to‑date free cash flow $1.6 billion", 2025‑Q3). NRG is highlighting above‑peer percentage growth versus prior year.

- Fact 39 — 2025 Financial Guidance Ranges (EPS $7.55–$8.15; adj EBITDA $3.875B–$4.025B; FCFbG $2.1B–$2.25B):
  - NRG: Set explicit full‑year 2025 ranges across EPS, EBITDA and FCFbG.
  - How it differs: Peers also give full‑year ranges; NRG’s EPS midpoint is comparable or slightly higher than some peer ranges (NTAP: EPS guidance "Range of $7 to $7.20", 2025‑Q1; ALLE: "Full‑Year Adjusted EPS $7.65 to $7.85", 2025‑Q1). NRG’s guidance is consistent with peers that have confident full‑year targets, though absolute ranges vary by company.

- Fact 46 — 2026 Adjusted EBITDA Guidance ($3.925B–$4.175B; midpoint $4.05B):
  - NRG: Provided 2026 adjusted EBITDA range with $4.05B midpoint.
  - How it differs: Peers provide adjusted EBITDA guidance in varied scales (PAYC: "Full‑Year Adjusted EBITDA $820M to $840M", 2024‑Q4; IQV: "2024 Adjusted EBITDA $3.700B to $3.800B", 2023‑Q4). NRG’s range sits in a multi‑billion band comparable to larger peers’ guidance windows.

- Fact 47 — 2026 FCFbG Guidance ($1.975B–$2.225B; midpoint $2.1B):
  - NRG: 2026 free cash flow before growth midpoint $2.1B.
  - How it differs: Peers’ FCF guidance varies widely (PLTR: "Adjusted Free Cash Flow Guidance between $1.5B and $1.7B", 2024‑Q4; VST: "adjusted free cash flow before growth $5.5B to $6.1B", 2024‑Q4). NRG’s midpoint is within peer ranges but lower than some large peers and higher than others — NRG frames 2026 FCF as constrained by financing/tax effects (see fact 50).

- Fact 50 — Higher Cash Interest and Taxes in 2026 (risk disclosure):
  - NRG: Foresees higher cash interest and taxes in 2026 (refinancing low‑cost debt; fewer federal tax credits), and therefore flat FCFbG YoY.
  - How it differs: Peers have also called out cash tax timing and its FCF impact (APP: "timing of cash tax payments influencing free cash flow", 2024‑Q4; EBAY: "Estimated free cash flow at $1.5 billion for 2025" noting tax headwinds, 2025‑Q2). NRG’s disclosure is specific about refinancing and loss of tax credits as drivers; peers often cite timing or general tax headwinds without the same refinancing emphasis.

- Fact 52 — Capital Return Commitments 2026+ (repurchases $1B; dividend growth 7%–9%):
  - NRG: Committed to $1B of repurchases and 7%–9% annualized dividend per share growth.
  - How it differs: Peers commonly reaffirm capital return programs (VTRS: "At least $1 billion" in capital return, 2024‑Q4; BDX: "Share repurchases $1 billion by year‑end", 2025‑Q2). NRG couples repurchases with an explicit dividend growth target (7%–9%) similar in spirit to utility/energy peers (SRE has used 7%–9% EPS CAGR framing). NRG’s approach mirrors peer practice but pairs buybacks and an explicit dividend growth cadence.

- Fact 53 — New Share Repurchase Authorization ($3B through 2028):
  - NRG: Board approved $3 billion repurchase authorization to 2028.
  - How it differs: Peers have approved similar‑sized repurchase programs (APP: "Share Repurchase Authorization $3.2 billion", 2025‑Q3; EFX: "Share Repurchase Program $3 billion over four years", 2025‑Q1). NRG’s $3B authorization is consistent with peer behavior.

- Fact 63 — Smart Home Customer Growth 2026 (expect similar / strong growth):
  - NRG: "We're assuming something very similar to what we saw this year... we expect really strong growth in '26 as well."
  - How it differs: NRG explicitly carries current Smart Home customer momentum into next year. Peers often express broad confidence in customer growth but across different businesses (EME: "Robust data center demand", 2025‑Q3). NRG links customer‑count continuity to near‑term guidance more directly.

- Fact 65 — Residential VPP Targets (1 GW by year‑end):
  - NRG: On track for "1 gig by year‑end" (raised guidance earlier from 20 MW to 150 MW and onward).
  - How it differs: NRG’s 1 GW residential VPP target is explicit and staged. Peers cite other multi‑GW PPA/PP targets (AES: "Target for new PPAs 14 to 17 gigawatts", 2024‑Q3) or year‑end construction targets (AES: "Year‑End Construction Target 3.5 gigawatts", 2023‑Q3). NRG’s 1 GW residential VPP is a concrete program target, smaller in absolute GW compared to some large renewables PPA goals but notable for the residential VPP category.

- Fact 13 — Texas Power Consumption Growth (~30% over 5 years):
  - NRG: "Total consumption across Texas has increased nearly 30% over the past 5 years."
  - How it differs: Peers have flagged Texas electricity demand growth as well but framed it differently (SRE: "Expected to nearly double by the end of the decade" / "annual premise growth ~2%", 2024‑Q2/2024‑Q4). NRG cites a specific 5‑year ~30% rise; peers often emphasize multi‑year acceleration or longer‑term doubling.

- Fact 14 — Data Center Demand Outlook (early, ramps to add meaningful capacity):
  - NRG: "Data center development usage remains early with ramp schedules expected to add meaningful capacity over the next several years."
  - How it differs: Peers similarly characterize data center demand as a major multi‑year driver and sometimes quantify growth (AES: "Demand from datacenters '22% annual growth'", 2024‑Q2; VST: "Expected to double by 2030", 2023‑Q4). NRG’s outlook is qualitatively aligned with peers but framed as an early‑stage ramp with future capacity additions.

- Fact 15 — Supply‑Demand Balance Outlook (demand to outpace new supply; market tightness):
  - NRG: Projects power demand will outpace new supply, keeping market structurally tight and reinforcing need for dispatchable generation.
  - How it differs: Peers also note tightening or improving demand/supply dynamics (DAL: "domestically, demand is improving as capacity rationalizes", 2024‑Q3; AES and others forecast large data center demand increases). NRG emphasizes the structural tightness and reliability premium — aligned in theme with peers, but NRG stresses dispatchable generation as the primary implication.

- Fact 68 — Data Center Contract Tenor (≥10 years, longer not shorter):
  - NRG: "people wanting at least 10 years, some even more than that... we're seeing longer contracts, not shorter ones."
  - How it differs: Peers corroborate longer contract trends (NOW: "Average contract terms tripled for five‑plus year deals year‑over‑year", 2024‑Q2; ARE: "Average duration of 9.4 years", 2025‑Q2; ORCL: "Demand for larger and longer contracts", 2025‑Q2). NRG’s observation is consistent with peer commentary but emphasizes an even longer tenor (10+ years) as the prevailing market preference.

- 事實 3 — 2026 年度指引引入：
  - NRG：引入與長期成長目標「一致」的 2026 年指引。
  - 差異：NRG 將 2026 指引表述為與多年目標對齊、偏向成長導向；同行則呈現混合態度——有的比較謹慎（SJM: "remain cautious in our fiscal year 2026 guidance"，2025‑Q4），有的提升或重申近年指引（EXPE: "Raising the full year guidance"，2025‑Q3；VTRS: "Reiterate guidance"，2025‑Q1）。NRG 較同業更顯示信心與長期對齊。

- 事實 5 — 資料中心已簽約供電容量（445 MW）：
  - NRG：本季新增 150 MW，"bringing total contracted capacity to 445 megawatts"。

- 事實 6 — 資料中心開發管線（5.4 GW）：
  - NRG：聯合開發與 LOI 管線達 5.4 gigawatts。
  - 差異：NRG 的 5.4 GW 有意義但小於某些同業報告的極大 mid/late‑stage 管線（FSLR: "79.2 gigawatts" mid‑to‑late stage，2025‑Q3；AES: "Over 50 gigawatts"，2023‑Q4）。同業強調更大規模的 GW 管線。

- 事實 8 — 第三季調整後每股盈餘（EPS）成長 32%：
  - NRG：第三季調整後 EPS 年增 32%。
  - 差異：NRG 呈現強勁雙位數成長（32%），而多數同業報告較溫和變動（OTIS: "Grew approximately 1% or $0.01"，2024‑Q3；IQV: "Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 14.1% YoY" 為 $2.84）。NRG 的 EPS 加速明顯高於多個同業。

- 事實 9 — 第三季調整後 EBITDA 達歷史新高：
  - NRG：調整後 EBITDA 創公司單季新高。
  - 差異：同業亦偶有紀錄高點（NCLH: "highest quarterly gross revenue and adjusted EBITDA recorded"，2024‑Q3），但 NRG 的紀錄是基於能源組合與分部驅動（電力零售、德州、Smart Home、資料中心等）。差別在於 NRG 的新高是由商品／合約與分部組合驅動。

- 事實 10 — 年初至今調整後 EPS 成長 36%：
  - NRG：YTD 調整後 EPS 年增 36%。
  - 差異：NRG 的 YTD EPS 成長顯著高於多數同業 YTD 數字（FISV: "YTD adjusted EPS $6.65"，2025‑Q3；SRE: "YTD adjusted EPS $2.24"，2024‑Q2）。NRG 強調超越同業的 YoY EPS 加速。

- 事實 17 — 從 LS/Rockland/TEF/VPP 新增容量（15 GW 天然氣、7 GW VPP）：
  - NRG："we are adding 15 gigawatts of natural gas and 7 gigawatts of virtual power plant capacity."
  - 差異：NRG 引述大規模新增（共 22 GW），並以專案與合作為基礎。同行多以較小單年新增或分年能力描述（CEG: "1,000 megawatts or more added to the grid"，2024‑Q1；AES: "Add 3.6 gigawatts of new projects in 2024"，2023‑Q4）。NRG 的計畫性 GW 級新增在規模上偏大。

- 事實 18 — 額外容量機會（透過 GE Vernova 與 TEF 約 6 GW）：
  - NRG："about 6 gigawatts of additional opportunities through the GE Vernova partnership and our final TEF project."
  - 差異：NRG 量化了合作驅動的 6 GW 選擇性機會；同業多以更概括的機會描述（IP: "Multiple opportunities for greenfield and brownfield investments"，2024‑Q3）或其他建設預期。NRG 提供具體合作相關的 GW 數字。

- 事實 19 — 本季簽署資料中心新協議（新增 150 MW）：
  - NRG："150 megawatts of new premium long‑term power agreements."
  - 差異：NRG 報告單季 150 MW 的新增；同業常以 GW/backlog 或金額動能呈現（FSLR: "54.5 gigawatts" backlog，2025‑Q3；GNRC: "Backlog doubled to over $300 million"，2025‑Q3）。NRG 採 MW 級逐季揭露，與同業的 GW/backlog 方式不同。

- 事實 21 — 資料中心定價目標（> $80/MWh）：
  - NRG："we are raising our target for new long‑term data center agreements to above $80 per megawatt hour."
  - 差異：NRG 以每兆瓦時價格目標呈現具體定價，同行多以成長率或營收表述（EME: "Expected growth high teens to mid‑20s"，2025‑Q3；STX: "data center revenue $2.1 billion"，2026‑Q1）。NRG 的揭露較為價格導向與具體。

- 事實 22 — LOI（意向書）成長 35%（較上季）：
  - NRG："signed letters of intent have increased 35% since last quarter."
  - 差異：NRG 量化 LOI 季增 35%。同業常以動能或營收/客戶項目描述（EME: "Momentum and demand in our markets"，2025‑Q2；SMCI: "Number of large‑scale data center customers increased"，2025‑Q4）。NRG 給出精確百分比，而同行多用描述性語言。

- 事實 26 — 2029 年 EPS 複合年增率（CAGR）目標 14%（不含資料中心）：
  - NRG："We also unveiled a 14% EPS CAGR through 2029... does not include any contribution from data centers..."
  - 差異：NRG 的 14% 長期 EPS 目標明顯高於許多同業（SRE: "Projected long‑term EPS CAGR 7% to 9%", 2025‑Q1）。NRG 的目標更具進取性，且標註保守前提（不含資料中心）。

- 事實 28 — 第三季 2025 調整後 EPS 與 EBITDA（$2.78 EPS；$1.205B EBITDA；+32% EPS、+14% EBITDA YoY）：
  - NRG：公布 $2.78 調整後 EPS 與 $1.205B 調整後 EBITDA。
  - 差異：NRG 的季度結果同時達高 EPS 與逾十億美元 EBITDA，與一些大型同行相近（EXPE: Q3 調整後 EBITDA "$1.4 billion"，2025‑Q3），但也高於許多中等規模同業的 EBITDA 水準。NRG 屬於能呈現十億級 EBITDA 的公司群。

- 事實 30 — 年初至今 2025 調整後 EPS 與 EBITDA（$7.17 EPS；> $3.2B EBITDA；+36% EPS、+12% EBITDA YoY）：
  - NRG：前三季累計 $7.17 調整後 EPS 與超過 $3.2B 調整後 EBITDA。
  - 差異：NRG 的 YTD EPS/EBITDA 成長強勁；同業 YTD 調整後 EBITDA 參考值各異（VST: "YTD adjusted EBITDA $2.227 billion"，2024‑Q2）。NRG 的 YTD 規模與成長領先於部分同業。

- 事實 31 — 德州區段 EBITDA 表現（$807M Q3；$1.618B YTD；+38% Q、+29% YTD）：
  - NRG：德州分部呈現高貢獻與強勁成長。
  - 差異：NRG 強調單一區域分部的顯著規模與成長；同業分部數字（例如 DXCM Q3 調整後 EBITDA "$368.4 million"，2025‑Q3）較小。NRG 的德州分部在規模及增幅上均高於許多同業的單一分部數字。

- 事實 33 — 東部區段 EBITDA（$107M Q3；$680M YTD）：
  - NRG：東部分部貢獻 $107M（Q3）與 $680M（YTD）。
  - 差異：與某些同業分部數字（DXCM Q3 "$368.4M"）相比，NRG 東部為中等規模貢獻；NRG 更強調其多分部組合（德州、Smart Home、West/Other）的結構性表現。

- 事實 34 — 西部/服務/其他區段 EBITDA（$19M Q3；$139M YTD）：
  - NRG：該分部為較小貢獻。
  - 差異：同業某些季度數字（TTD 估計 Q3 調整後 EBITDA "$277M"，2025‑Q2）較高；NRG 表示某些分部規模較小，整體表現由大型分部帶動。

- 事實 36 — Smart Home EBITDA 與成長驅動（$272M Q3；$803M YTD；創紀錄新客戶與留存、淨服務利差擴大）：
  - NRG：將 Smart Home EBITDA 的成長歸因於創紀錄的新客戶新增、留存率與淨服務利差擴大。
  - 差異：NRG 明確以營運 KPI（客戶新增與留存）來解釋利潤擴張；同業較常以營收成長描述（EME: "Revenue growth in data centers almost double"，2025‑Q3）。NRG 對於獲利改善的運營因果鏈更為明確。

- 事實 37 — 合併 FCFbG 年初至今成長（$828M 季、$2.035B YTD，年增 42%）：
  - NRG：季度 FCFbG $828M、YTD $2.035B，較去年同期增加 $597M（+42%）。
  - 差異：NRG 報告非常強勁的 FCFbG 成長；同業 FCFbG 參考（VST: "adjusted free cash flow before growth ~$2.888B for 2024"，2024‑Q4；STZ: "YTD free cash flow $1.6B"，2025‑Q3）。NRG 在 YoY 成長率上優於多數同業示例。

- 事實 39 — 2025 年財務指引範圍（EPS $7.55–$8.15；調整後 EBITDA $3.875B–$4.025B；FCFbG $2.1B–$2.25B）：
  - NRG：公布完整年度 2025 的 EPS / EBITDA / FCFbG 範圍。
  - 差異：同業亦提供全年範圍；NRG 的 EPS 中值與部分同業接近或略高（NTAP: "Range of $7 to $7.20"，2025‑Q1；ALLE: "Full‑Year Adjusted EPS $7.65 to $7.85"，2025‑Q1）。NRG 的指引與自信度與多數同業一致，但絕對範圍因公司規模不同而異。

- 事實 46 — 2026 年調整後 EBITDA 指引（$3.925B–$4.175B；中值 $4.05B）：
  - NRG：公布 2026 調整後 EBITDA 範圍，中值 $4.05B。
  - 差異：同業調整後 EBITDA 指引尺度不一（PAYC: "FY Adjusted EBITDA $820M–$840M"，2024‑Q4；IQV: "2024 Adjusted EBITDA $3.700B–$3.800B"，2023‑Q4）。NRG 的多億美元級範圍與大型同業的數字相當。

- 事實 47 — 2026 年 FCFbG 指引（$1.975B–$2.225B；中值 $2.1B）：
  - NRG：2026 年 FCFbG 中值 $2.1B。
  - 差異：同業的 FCF 指引分布甚廣（PLTR: "Adjusted FCF Guidance $1.5B–$1.7B"，2024‑Q4；VST: "adjusted FCFbG $5.5B–$6.1B"，2024‑Q4）。NRG 的中值位於同業範圍內，但低於某些大型同業且高於其他公司；NRG 同時指出 2026 受利息與稅項影響（見事實 50）。

- 事實 50 — 2026 年現金利息及稅負上升（風險揭露）：
  - NRG：預計 2026 年現金利息與稅負上升（再融資低利成本債務；較少聯邦稅收抵免），因此 FCFbG 年比年持平。
  - 差異：同業亦指出現金稅項與 FCF 的時序影響（APP: "timing of cash tax payments influencing free cash flow"，2024‑Q4；EBAY: "Estimated FCF $1.5B for 2025" 並指出稅項逆風，2025‑Q2）。NRG 特別強調再融資與稅收抵免減少為主因，表述相對具體。

- 事實 52 — 資本回報承諾 2026+（回購 $1B；普通股股利年化成長 7%–9%）：
  - NRG：承諾透過 $1B 回購與 7%–9% 年化股利成長回報股東。
  - 差異：同業常重申資本回報計畫（VTRS: "At least $1 billion"，2024‑Q4；BDX: "Share repurchases $1 billion by year‑end"，2025‑Q2）。NRG 將回購與具體股利成長率綁定，且 7%–9% 與某些公用事業同業的長期目標範圍類似（SRE 亦使用 7%–9% 類似框架）。

- 事實 53 — 新回購授權（$3B，至 2028 年）：
  - NRG：董事會核准新的 $3B 回購授權至 2028 年。
  - 差異：同業也有類似規模授權（APP: "Share Repurchase Authorization $3.2B"，2025‑Q3；EFX: "Share Repurchase Program $3B over four years"，2025‑Q1）。NRG 的 $3B 規模與同業一致。

- 事實 63 — Smart Home 客戶增長 2026（預期與今年相似且強勁）：
  - NRG："In terms of customer counts, we're assuming something very similar to what we saw this year... we expect really strong growth in '26 as well."
  - 差異：NRG 將今年的客戶動能直接延續至 2026。同行也表達客戶/需求增長的樂觀（例如 EME: "Robust data center demand"，2025‑Q3），但 NRG 更直接把客戶數持平／持續成長納入明年假設。

- 事實 65 — 住宅 VPP 目標（年底前 1 GW）：
  - NRG："we remain on track for our 1 gig by year‑end."
  - 差異：NRG 的住宅 VPP 1 GW 目標具體且分階段（今年曾從 20 MW 到 150 MW 提高）。同行在 PPA／PP 目標上有更高絕對量（AES: "Target for new PPAs 14 to 17 gigawatts"，2024‑Q3；AES 年終建設目標 3.5 GW，2023‑Q3）。NRG 的 1 GW 在住宅 VPP 領域具體但在 GW 絕對量上小於某些大型 PPA 目標。

- 事實 13 — 德州用電消費成長（過去 5 年近 30%）：
  - NRG："Total consumption across Texas has increased nearly 30% over the past 5 years."
  - 差異：同業也提到德州電力需求成長但語境不同（SRE: "Expected to nearly double by the end of the decade" / "annual premise growth ~2%", 2024‑Q2/2024‑Q4）。NRG 提供 5 年 ~30% 的具體數字；同業多以更長期或年增率表述。

- 事實 14 — 資料中心需求展望（仍處於早期，未來數年將增加顯著容量）：
  - NRG："Data center development usage remains early with ramp schedules expected to add meaningful capacity over the next several years."
  - 差異：同業也視資料中心為多年度主要驅動並常量化成長（AES: "Demand from datacenters '22% annual growth'", 2024‑Q2；VST: "Expected to double by 2030", 2023‑Q4）。NRG 的觀點與同業一致，但著重於「早期」及未來 ramp 的意涵。

- 事實 15 — 供需平衡展望（需求將超越新增供給，市場結構性緊繃）：
  - NRG："power demand is projected to outpace new supply, keeping the market structurally tight ..."
  - 差異：同業亦提及供需改善或緊繃（DAL: "demand is improving as capacity rationalizes", 2024‑Q3；AES 等預測資料中心大幅增加需求）。NRG 強調結構性緊繃與對「可調度發電」的需求，主張重點與同業方向一致但語氣更強調可靠性溢酬。

- 事實 68 — 資料中心合約年期（至少 10 年，甚至更長）：
  - NRG："we still continue to see people wanting at least 10 years, some even more than that... we're seeing longer contracts, not shorter ones."
  - 差異：同業也觀察到合約年期拉長（NOW: "Average contract terms tripled for five‑plus year deals YoY", 2024‑Q2；ARE: "Average duration 9.4 years", 2025‑Q2；ORCL: "Demand for larger and longer contracts", 2025‑Q2）。NRG 觀察到市場偏好 10 年以上合約，與同業趨勢一致但在年期上更為明確。

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

---

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

David Hsiao: Welcome to AppLovin's earnings call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. I'm David Hsiao, Head of Investor Relations. Joining me today to discuss our results are Adam Foroughi, our Co-Founder, CEO and Chairperson; and Matt Stumpf, our CFO. Please note, our SEC filings to date as well as our financial update and press release discussing our third quarter performance are available at investors.applovin.com. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the future development and reach of our platform, including the expected timing of product launches, our share repurchase program, the efficiency of our operations, the expected future financial performance of the company and other future events. These statements are based on our current assumptions and beliefs, and we assume no obligation to update them, except as required by law. Our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted. We encourage you to review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. Additional information may also be found in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025, which will be filed today. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be superior to or a substitute for our GAAP results. Please be sure to review the GAAP results and the reconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and financial update available on our Investor Relations site. This conference call is being recorded, and a replay will be available for a period of time on our IR website. Now I'll turn it over to Adam and Matt for some opening remarks, then we'll have the moderator take us through Q&A.
Adam Foroughi: Thank you all for joining us today. First, I'd like to recognize our inclusion in the S&P 500, a huge milestone for our company and a strong acknowledgment of what we built. It's a privilege we do not take lightly. It also means we now carry the expectations of a much broader set of investors, and we must push even harder to continue delivering. Turning to our business. Q3 was another very good quarter. Our performance was strong with gaming advertising continuing on a solid trajectory. Our teams delivered multiple incremental lifts in our core models this quarter. And our MAX supply-side platform, one of the best indicators of our end market growth continues to grow at very healthy rates. We also opened up international traffic for advertisers promoting websites or shops in Q3 ahead of schedule. I'm particularly proud of our team because even while executing a strong quarter, we also delivered our major October 1 launch of our self-service platform and referral form. We did so without any significant hiccups, no major bugs and effective filtering out of low-quality ad accounts, something I was personally monitoring closely. This speaks volumes about our ability to automate and execute. I know everyone wants stats on how self-service is going. And instead of something specific around accounts or ramp-up since we're still very early, I'd like to point out a stat which I watch very closely. While it takes a while for new customers to get going, to integrate, to learn how to use our system and to ramp spend, we're already seeing spend from these self-service advertisers grow around roughly 50% week-over-week. It's too soon to be significant, but this type of early growth gives us even more confidence that our platform will excel at being an open platform to any type of advertiser. Our focus for Q4 and 2026 will be the following, with priority always given to improving our models for all advertisers. We'll continue tuning our onboarding flows and ramping more AI agents into the workflow to support a seamless experience for new advertisers. Once we're satisfied with the quality and experience, we'll open the platform broadly beyond referral basis. We'll be testing generative AI-based ad creatives. Over time, if we can move to mostly automated creative generation, we believe user response rates to more customized ads on our platform will materially improve. We are actively testing paid marketing to promote the Axon Ads platform to new customers. We'll continue tuning this acquisition method so that when we launch the platform beyond referral in 2026, we can scale advertiser count without a reliance on a large sales force. If we maintain execution discipline, we are well positioned to acquire a large volume of new advertisers in the coming years. We believe that giving our powerful recommendation engine, a more diverse set of advertisers to recommend will dramatically improve conversion rates, paving the way for elevated growth rates for years to come. It's worth noting the backdrop. The market is recognizing our platform, our scalability and the reach we offer our partners and the institutional dynamics that come with the S&P 500 inclusion are already in motion. At the same time, we continue to operate in an environment of heightened scrutiny around data, privacy and ad tech practices. We remain committed to strict compliance, transparency and execution excellence. To conclude, we delivered a very strong Q3. We are executing on our strategic priorities, and we are confident that our best days are ahead as we broaden access to our self-service platform and scale globally. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt for a deeper dive into the numbers.
Matt Stumpf: Thanks, Adam, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Q3 was another exceptional quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.405 billion, up 68% year-over-year due to model updates in the core gaming business, while adjusted EBITDA was $1.158 billion, up 79% at an 82% margin, up 1% quarter-over-quarter from operating leverage and a modest reduction in operational FX. Quarter-over-quarter flow-through to adjusted EBITDA was 95%, slightly above Q2. Free cash flow was $1.049 billion, up 92% year-over-year. Free cash flow margin improved sequentially given no semiannual cash interest paid on our debt this quarter as those payments occur in Q2 and Q4 of each year. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased and withheld approximately 1.3 million shares for $571 million funded by free cash flow. Over the last 3 quarters, we have reduced our weighted average diluted common shares outstanding from 346 million in Q4 of last year to 341 million this quarter. During the quarter, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an incremental $3.2 billion. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for next quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2025, we anticipate revenue between $1.570 billion and $1.6 billion, reflecting between 12% and 14% sequential growth. With adjusted EBITDA between $1.290 billion and $1.320 billion, targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 82% to 83%. Now with that, let's move to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from James Heaney.
James Heaney: Could you just start off talking about the characteristics of the advertisers that you've onboarded since October 1? Would you say the GMV of the advertisers are smaller than the initial 600 that you had in the pilot? Or are you going down -- more down market? Just any help there would be great.
Adam Foroughi: Yes. Sure, James. They are obviously filtered set of advertisers when we curated the list last year. That was filtered by our team. And then this year, it's filtered through referrals. So these aren't like your local dry cleaner trying to come on to the platform yet. They are predominantly shops. They're not going to be as large as they were in the cohort last year, but they're not going to be materially smaller either. So think of them as comparable in mix. And then it's a broad set of categories. There's no limitation when you're open the way we are through a referral to the type of customer that comes in. So a broad set of shopping categories being represented.
James Heaney: Great. And then just one for Matt. Could you just talk about guidance philosophy for Q4? Just curious how you've used e-com seasonality from last Q4 as a proxy for this year? And just interested to hear kind of what's being assumed from sort of the current customers versus new customers on the e-com side?
Matt Stumpf: Yes, sure. It's not the best comp. Obviously, last year, we had an entirely new e-commerce business that was ramping. And then this quarter, right, we had an existing base. So it's not best comparison year-over-year. So within the guidance, we took an approach where it reflects a combination of different factors that we have going on at the company, obviously, the optimism around the e-commerce referral program, continued model enhancements, the updates that we talked about previously within the Q3 period and then also kind of normal holiday seasonality. So the combination of those factors led to the larger guidance that we're projecting quarter-over-quarter.
Operator: Your next question will come from Omar Dessouky with BofA.
Omar Dessouky: Adam, I wanted to get back to your comments about substantially higher conversion rates. So am I to read that as -- that a significant growth in impressions would not be required to absorb a significant increase in e-commerce advertisers in 2026?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. I mean, look, we've always said we serve a lot of impressions to a lot of users today, over 1 billion users a day. So we're in a world today where the biggest lever for growth on our business, given we report on a net revenue basis is increasing the conversion rate. And that happens from a couple of things. You've got the model enhancements, which we always talk about. Those are super impactful in increasing conversion rate. That's a continuous effort. We are in the very, very beginnings of understanding how to work with neural nets and these AI technologies. I mean if you think about this industry and the core AI industry is only a few years old of engineers really being able to extract this kind of value out of these tools and technologies across a broad range of industries. So as this goes forward, we're going to have consistent incremental improvements and sometimes large, sometimes small, but additive to high impact on driving up conversion rate from technology lifts. Then you're also going to get advertiser density expanding paired with our recommendation system, giving the model the chance to personalize the advertising to the user better. If we have less advertisers and less categories, we just have less to show. So you can't get a diverse set of content to the customer to maximize that conversion rate. Both those things are just going to naturally happen as we go forward. The third piece that I touched on to your phrase you repeated, is that generative AI-based creative. Today, in our advertising system, the advertiser can do almost no targeting. They can pick their country, they can put in their economic goals, they can put in a budget and off they go. The one manual lever is creative. And in particular, in the shopping category or in this like website advertising business, a lot of the customers come on board and they don't have a creative that's adapted for our platform. The average viewership of our ads is roughly 35 seconds. The average viewership of an ad on social is roughly 7 seconds. So a lot of these customers are coming in and just porting a short ad and trying to replicate what they have on social on our platform, and it's mismatched. It diminishes their possible conversion rate. So what does that mean? Well, when we get into a world where we can use generative AI tools to automatically create ad creatives on behalf of these customers, they're going to get to a point where they can actually expand their conversion rate. We're doing nothing more other than just expanding the count of creatives into our system and ensuring that the types of creatives in our system follow best practices on our platform and doing that at no cost. And so we're really excited about where the tools in the marketplace are going. That's something we're going to be testing in short order here.
Omar Dessouky: And if I could just follow up. So you've addressed the conversion rate question I had very clearly. But I did want to touch on how you're thinking about supply, even though, obviously, you've clearly -- you said that the conversion rate is a big driver. So in the past, you've talked about double-digit growth in publisher revenue in MAX, over the past few years. And I'm wondering if you expect that to accelerate as e-commerce ramps. Do you see supply driven primarily by higher ad load as dictated by publishers, higher engagement with mobile games overall or improvements to MAX like those you shipped in 2024? Like which of those factors would be most important?
Adam Foroughi: I mean it's a combination of all of the above. The MAX platform ecosystem is growing really quickly. happens from a couple of different factors. One is, as the ads become higher quality, and we look at e-commerce shopping and just demand density, it's higher quality because the user stops seeing game, game, game, game, game when they're stuck to a game that they actually like. So if you bring more diversity of content, you'd expect retention to go up and ad supply to expand. So that's going to be a natural tailwind inside this ecosystem that will unlock as we get more demand outside of just core advertisers that we have today. Second part of that is what we've talked about in past calls is the unlock of getting these publishers who are in-app purchasing predominantly don't tend to run ads or run ads at a very, very small percentage. If you're monetizing a high LTV game and most of the gaming customers are residing in these deep games, you don't want to run ads for your competition. Well, they didn't have a way to monetize as well as gaming ads in the past. So if we can unlock this material demand shift, then we're going to be able to bring more supply into the ecosystem. That's very advantageous for supply as well. So it's a combination of those 2 things. And then, of course, you've got -- as our models improve, the same customer, that publisher can buy more users that are retained in their game, so they can create more growth in audience, and they'll get better tools as well to better monetize that audience.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Bazinet: So a quick question. I appreciate that 50% growth in week-over-week spend from these e-commerce customers. Is there any sort of context you can give us of like when you looked at that same metric during the pilot phase, what was it? Or how do you know that that's a good number or a bad number? I mean it sounds great.
Adam Foroughi: I mean, look, like one of the simpler mathematical functions is extrapolation, right? So like we're starting pretty early here. It's a month in. And it does take a while for these customers to ramp up. Remember, ours is not a plug-and-play solution. They got to come in. They have to integrate pixels. They've got to go live. All of that takes time. So just to get to a point of go-live is a week plus usually. Some can do it very quickly, but it's not common to be able to do it in a day. So you have a period of lag time from October 1 to even a cohort going live. And then this cohort is not as big as what the absolute numbers were that we reported, I think we disclosed in Q1 this year of how big that cohort last year swelled to. But given the ramp-up, the ramp-up is really swift. So we're excited that if this continues to compound at the rate it is and then you keep adding new customers, this thing is going to then snowball on itself. And the true value for us right now is not go, okay, how do we extrapolate this out to when customers in this category become a bigger and bigger part of our business. It's more are we actually building a tool that we have confidence is going to succeed in converting a lot of customers over time. And that breaks down into a few things we look at. Of course, I get excited by seeing scaling spend, but I'm more excited about the fact that we didn't introduce a ton of bucks. We didn't have a bunch of customer complaints. We didn't bring in low-quality advertisers. Anything that was low quality was automatically kicked off the platform. So the team enabled a whole bunch of tools to get a product release that was not immaterial into market in a seamless manner. And now we're in a point of optimization. One point of optimization that's key is when a customer signs up, is it easy for them to understand the value proposition and get through integration to the point of go live. That's something we're really focused on optimizing because as we mentioned, we do want to eventually promote the Axon platform to future customers. And if we want to do that, just like any advertiser in the world, we've got to optimize our conversion funnel. The other piece that's important is our teams are constantly working on embedding tools into the interface, so large language model powered tools that allow the customer to get support without interfacing with us. We're not seeing a huge influx of customer support tickets. We're seeing these customers go live, be able to manage themselves, get best practices extracted out of the tools we've enabled in the dash, and that's fantastic to see. So what I look at when I see this ramp-up is not I'm extrapolating to how is this going to become billions and billions of dollars. It's more that the fact that it's working already a month in, and we're not getting bombarded with customer complaints, and we're not seeing a ton of issues implies that we're on the right track to eventually get open in '26 and really be able to bring in a ton of advertisers over the following quarters and years.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Clark Lampen with BTIG.
William Lampen: Sorry, I have like 4 mute buttons right that I had to take out.
Adam Foroughi: Complex setup over there, Clark.
William Lampen: Right. It's a little too complicated. Okay. So as we're thinking about, I guess, the growth of what has the potential to be like a really big business for you guys over time, billions of incremental as you just sort of talked about. I'm curious how you think about balancing growth, chasing sort of new pockets of potential supply and building up demand to go after that with displacement for your core gaming customer because you are introducing a new bidder with potentially higher transaction value or consumer LTV. Is that something that model improvements and a faster pace of model enhancement will sort of take care of along the way? Or how do you, if any, think about gating the growth of this business if you have to for managing the core -- for the purposes of managing the core?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. I mean, look, one, we don't try to gate growth. So we sort of look at a platform as it's going to develop and evolve as it does. But understanding these models gives me confidence that as we get more density of advertisers, we're actually going to have expanded spend for gaming customers, not diminished spend. And this is a bit counterintuitive, but here's why. The model today, if you go back a year prior to us getting into e-commerce and shops, you ended up having 1,000 impressions to show a user and you bombarded them with games. Well, that's not a great offering. It's as if you had a social network that was showing short-form video and said I'm only going to show golf videos. Everyone who's on the golf videos at that moment would churn. Well, in our case, the customers aren't churning. They're playing games, but they're not going to convert. And our conversion rates are really low. There are moments when the model knows a user is going to be in the game. When those moments happen, the CPM for a game advertiser is phenomenal. It's really, really high. Our average conversion rate is that 1% that we've given a year plus ago. So maybe it's higher now, but just for this example, let's use 1%. We're driving 10 game installs over 1,000 impressions, but we're probably wasting 80%, 90% of those impressions because the model knows in a tight percentage of impressions, games are going to convert, this user is ready for something new and the CPM there will beat anything else that comes along. So you go and bring in demand density. What happens? Now the model can better use all that access impression. And so if it does, what's going to happen is your gaming customer is not going to diminish. It's just going to be more targeted. So maybe impressions go down, CPM goes up for them, but everything is priced to revenue for our customers. So they get the same revenue out. And then these new customers better monetize the user and give them more diversity of content, which hopefully will train them to better engage with our ads. And then you take it to the next level, which is now all of a sudden, we're getting data from way more types of customers. We now know, let's say, tomorrow, someone buys a $5,000 handbag on a website, that's the data point we didn't have a year ago. That data point, my simple mind, can probably tell you that's a good user for Candy Crush if they haven't played Candy Crush. The neural net is going to tell you a lot more than that based on its correlations. And so you're building up a data set that doesn't just limit itself to the shopping category or the website advertising category. It helps enable better advertising for the gaming customers as well. So you put all those pieces together, and I'm really confident that we're not going to squeeze anyone in our platform. We're probably going to have expansion across the board as we add more demand density and get more data into the system.
William Lampen: That's helpful. Maybe just as a very quick follow-up. You guys highlighted tuning the onboarding flows and generative AI creative. How far away are you or sort of at what sort of rate are we making progress to sort of getting one of those tools live? Would either of those things, I guess, be a gating factor to launching or introducing GA at this point? Or are they vital to going to a broader customer base?
Adam Foroughi: So the Axon Ads site is a prompt at this point. And part of the logic of doing that was to get inputs into that prompt, so we can tune a bot that's external facing and then bring it internal. So we're in the midst of doing that, and that's not far off. So we'll have different implementations of bots inside the site. I mean, as you know, and we've talked about last quarter, when a customer uploads ads or uploads a website to promote, we're not manually checking it. There's a bot there that's automatically checking for our quality and ensuring that the quality meets the standard that we need on the platform, both for the creative and for the website being promoted or the application. So we already have various points of bots into the tool, and we'll have more. It's just going to get better as we get more data in, and we can tune it so that it's actually accurate across the board. The generative AI-based ad creatives don't depend entirely on us. But Sora 2 came out this past quarter. That was another step forward. Veo 3 keeps getting better. So you can assume these tools are getting pretty close. We're not -- we're probably far away from the point where the model itself can recursively just go and create more content and just bring more ads into the system. But we're probably not very far away, and I'm hoping, in a matter of weeks or months to be able to test generative AI-based creative that we create with a little help, some tooling on top of the large language models and then submit to the advertisers for approval. That in itself can really explode the count of ads on the platform. And so that's not far off. So on your last question of are these gating to general release, I don't think so. I think the main thing that we care about there is how we tune the flows. Is the conversion funnel appropriate? Are customers getting confused or are they getting a good experience from onboarding to ramping? If they're getting a seamless experience, and we're not getting overly overwhelmed with inbound complaints or concerns or need for support, then we're ready to go open.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alec Brondolo with Wells Fargo.
Alec Brondolo: I appreciate it. I think as we've kind of spoken about direct payments and this transition from kind of paying the App Store and the Play Store 30% to going to an O&O payment product, we've kind of talked about this, I think, historically as more of a medium- to long-term tailwind. Do you think that might be manifesting sooner than expected? And did it contribute to third quarter results?
Adam Foroughi: I don't think it's contributing much at all yet. I think it is going to be over the quarters that it's going to take impact. I don't think it's realistic that 30% tax goes to low single digits. So let's just take the midpoint, 15%. That's a material lift in LTV for a lot of these in-app purchasing games, roughly 20%. Some portion of that is going to go into development of more content, which is great. They're going to make better games. Some portion of that, they'll bank into the bottom line. Some portion of that will go to marketing companies. I mean I'll say the one thing about our business always is we don't try to think about what's happening outside of us. This is something that's outside of our control. It's up to the platforms, regulators and then the content creators. It's not up to us. What's up to us and inside our control is how good our tools are. Q3 was driven by what we said on the earnings script. The models continue to get better, iterative improvements in the template, more advertisements on the platform, more advertisers on the platform, all of that's compounding to really quick growth rate. even in the core category. We're still believing very confidently in this 20% to 30% long-term growth rate in our core category. But even in the core, we're beating that. And then now you're layering on, on top of that, all this opportunity with the self-service platform. So we're really excited about where we are focused on what we have underneath our control.
Alec Brondolo: Perfect. And maybe if I could ask a follow-up. I think there's always been this talk about eventually extending the reach of supply. Like right now, most of the ads are placed in mobile games and then the idea is perhaps over time, we could go to other surfaces. It seems like some combination of AdX and Google Ads Manager might come up for sale as a function of the Google ad tech, antitrust trial. Would you be interested in those assets if they were available?
Adam Foroughi: I mean, without commenting on what else is out there, like commenting about our business, the reality with our business is we think about providing the best solution to our partners. For the advertisers, we believe we're on the track to really give them a good way to access a really large audience playing games. For the game publisher and then expanding publishers as we get to more publishers on our platform, we've built them very good tools to monetize and promote their products and grow their businesses. As we think about going broader than that, the open web publishers and other app publishers that currently can't access our tools the same way could use better monetization. We all know that category is pretty slow growth. And then we talked about CTV in the past, too. Everywhere else is struggling to monetize except in the walled gardens and except on games, predominantly because of the success of our platforms. And so if that's the case, we look at that as our potential prospect clients as well. We should be able to extend our product offering over time to those folks. We need more demand. We're not demand -- we're not supply constrained today, we're demand constrained. But if we do our job right and bring on a lot of advertisers, it serves us well because it serves them well to be able to extend our offering out to more publishers.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball.
Vasily Karasyov: Adam, I wanted to follow up on what you said earlier about LTV calculations that you think your advertisers do. So if given the variance in growth rates in in-app purchases market and in-app advertising market, right? So can you comment on what you see if the -- your advertisers' LTV calculations are evolving, let's say, compared to a year ago compared to now, I would think that the advertising component would be much higher now, right? Going and how do you -- what it means for you?
Adam Foroughi: So look, generally, as a whole, the in-app purchasing market is more mature than the in-app advertising market. So we're seeing much faster growth rates on the MAX platform. We've said multiples faster than the in-app purchasing market grows because those publishers, both the older publishers in that category are getting better tools, both for growth and monetization. And then newer publishers see these other publishers scaling, so they integrate more ads. So you're seeing more supply come online and existing supply monetize better. In-app purchasing market isn't really creating that many more monetization tools. It requires for growth, this tax to go down if the 30% goes to 15%, that creates a really big tailwind, and it creates better monetization mechanics. That's really hard in that category. It's up to the game developers, but it's not uniform across the platform. And then it requires more IAP games. There's a really big set of games that are just mature in that category that frankly don't really have much of a way to grow anymore. And then there are newer ones that constantly come live. If you look in the top 10 to 20 in-app purchasing -- top grossing games, there's a huge mix of games that have launched in the last 2 years that are now on the top 20. So there's new ones that go live that help grow there. But for us, what we're focused on is where we can drive an impact. We can help the in-app purchasing ones promote themselves. The in-app advertising ones are really exciting for us because they power our true market. The true market is the supply side on MAX. And as we give them better monetization tools and better growth tools, we see that supply expanding. That supply expanding the growth rate there is the direct market that helps us grow. And then hopefully, we can grow on top of that even more because of improvements in all the other parts of our business.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Cost: Thank you for the 50% week-on-week growth metric that is really interesting. Is that the metric that you're managing to try to find the point at which you're going to go general availability? And if not, what are you looking at? Like what will be the things that you need to knock down for that to happen?
Adam Foroughi: All these things take time to build. So I don't like spend -- obviously, if spend wasn't going up a lot, I'd be a lot more concerned when you got a business in any scale growing 50% week-over-week, there's a reason to be excited. But what I care more about is that we have time to optimize the funnel. We need to make sure the conversion funnel is optimized. This is just like launching a B2C property. Your first funnel is not going to be your best funnel. We've already optimized it once. So what's today on the site is better than what was on the site 4 weeks ago. But there's room for improvement there. Your communications with the clients, the e-mails that the potential clients get after they sign up, we can improve that. We can improve the tooling inside the dashboard, all the AI bots that we've talked about. And so there's different aspects of this that we just need time to get to a place where we go, this meets our quality standard, then we're ready to open up. Because if we open up today, we may be okay, we may not. We may get inundated with user concerns as you shrink the size of the advertiser. So one day, I'd like to make sure that, that local laundromat that signs up gets a great experience promoting themselves to this gamer audience on our platform. And if we're not ready yet today, we're going to take our time to get there. We don't think it's a long time away. I think I'd said on our prior earnings call for '26. So this isn't a very long time away. We're just going to take our time to ensure that we've got the product at the level that we want.
Matthew Cost: Great. And then on the paid marketing front, I think you talked last quarter and maybe even mentioned in passing this quarter, the opportunity to do more of that. It looks like based on your sales and marketing budget in the third quarter that it wasn't something that you started to lean into. So how should we think about the timing and potential magnitude of doing more marketing?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. So we're testing right now actively. Testing budget is going to be not large. Even if we ever scale this, the scale of our business is quite large. So like some of the largest advertisers in the world can only spend a couple of hundred million dollars a year. So as you think about the scale of our business, it's never going to be a very large line item against the revenue potential. But because our LTV is so high, and we're optimizing our conversion rate, and we think we can get that to be really compelling and the brand isn't known, the setup is really good for promoting our product to potential end customers. And so -- if that's the case, and we know we have a great LTV to cost of user acquisition, we'll spend. We'll break it out, as it scales, we'll show the unit economics so people can understand what we're doing, but we're really good performance marketers, I think we can all agree at this point. So we're not going to waste money on this. We're not brand marketers. The dollars will be much greater than the dollars we spend on user acquisition. And it's -- for me, it's the full-blown automation of a sales force. We'll need some salespeople, but we can keep a very lean sales team in line with our traditional culture if we can automate onboarding through advertising all the way to point of go live.
Operator: Our next question will come from Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank.
Benjamin Black: Is there any reason to think that the take rate or revenue margin from your e-com spend should be any different to that of the core gaming business? So any structural differences, I guess, to the advertising credits you're offering folks early on, perhaps lower the conversion temporarily. But longer term, are there any differences to be aware of?
Adam Foroughi: No. I mean, look, the advertising credits we offer is such a tiny fraction to overall value of a new customer. So it's no different than like a cost of user acquisition if we got the customer through paid marketing. So it's just really low. So consider that immaterial. The business is not built to, say, web advertising or shops is treated differently than games. It's one unified auction. We're a single platform. So when we get a higher conversion rate, whether that comes from gaming or shops or any category, it's going to have a constant take rate across the board. It just implies that more density equals better conversion rate, possibly higher take.
Benjamin Black: All right. Great. And then second question would be sort of you're clearly growing your ambitions within AI automation more broadly. So maybe talk to us about sort of your investment priorities as we sort of look ahead to the next year. I'd imagine your sort of compute capacity requirements are likely scaling. So sort of how does that play into sort of your expense outlook as we look ahead to the next year?
Adam Foroughi: Yes, we're pay-as-you go. So like I mean, we try to project and buy, in particular, GPUs, that being the more lead time dependent part of the stack. We try to buy those a year in advance. So if you've looked at the financials, you'll see spikes in infrastructure investment, but it runs through the P&L. It's not capitalized, and we do plan it really effectively. And we don't try to really overinvest ahead of revenue. We want to make sure we're really disciplined. And that's completely aligned with our culture where we want to be cost disciplined in every aspect of the business.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Chris Kuntarich with UBS.
Christopher Kuntarich: Hopefully, you can hear me. Just wanted to ask on web-based becoming available to EU advertisers. Any update there? And then, Matt, just a quick follow-up. Are you making any assumptions about advertisers that aren't currently onboarded in the 4Q guide?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. On the EU side, so we can work with EU advertisers today. We just don't open up our inventory for website or shop advertisers in the EU region of our audience. So just a clarification bullet. It's -- EU tends to be somewhere in the low teens percentage of our business, if I remember off the top of my head. So it's not a huge priority versus expanding out the business. GDPR rules are more restrictive and require a build-out for us. So we'll get to it in due time. It's not a priority against getting to general release of our platform and building out the rest of these tools we've talked about.
Matt Stumpf: Yes. And in terms of guidance, I think we've done pretty consistent to our approach thus far. We've communicated before that we guide to kind of where we feel very comfortable that we could potentially land. So we guide to what we know. We don't guide to try to estimate for something that's unpredictable. And in this case, we can't predict the number or the volume of new advertisers coming on to the system through the referral program and how that potential ramp in spend could happen through the quarter. So there is no incremental assumption built into the guide for onboarding of incremental customers.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Rob Sanderson with Loop Capital.
Robert Sanderson: I have 2. Just in terms of kind of understanding more of the sort of the current points of friction to bringing people on, it sounds like you're doing a lot of work to tune the onboarding flow. But sort of what other points of friction are necessary to address to just further optimize? And then you've also said that you're not seeing a ton of complaints, but I'm sure you are getting asks for features and things. So maybe what are some common sort of asks for feature add to Axon Ads Manager?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. So the first question, I mean, like you've got 2 points of this funnel, pre getting-to-us. So eventually, we've got to get the brand out there. We got to be able to market the platform. We've got to -- we're constrained by how many referral codes we gave out. So like just advertisers coming to the Axon platform and signing up. So let's set that aside because we purposefully constrained that. After the sign-up, we want to make sure we have as little drop-off as possible. Of course, with any product, when you get a sign-up, not every sign-up is going to be qualified, but we think a lot of these are qualified. So we're optimizing to as high a rate as we can from sign-up to go live. In terms of feature requests, surprisingly, not a whole lot. This is like, I would say, hard to guarantee that it will be that going forward because we're only a month in. So like if there's a lag time to integration and ramp up, and we're seeing the swift growth, you don't have time for these customers to really understand the platform yet. So that may change, but we get more feature requests from our current cohort of customers, the ones that went live a year ago, much more so than what we brought on in the last month.
Robert Sanderson: If I could ask on international. You mentioned that you launched a little early. And it sounds like no EU. So maybe where are you available? Anything surprising or different about the behavior from this cohort? And then just anything you can share on next steps to expanding? I mean, you probably have some language optimization to do, I'm sure, and channel development work, but kind of what are -- sort of what are some of the next steps to make international a much bigger component?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. So first off, it's everywhere in the world, except for EU traffic for web shops and web advertisers. App advertisers are everywhere in the world. We don't operate inside China, so -- but the rest of the world is there. In our business, the customers that we have today are mostly Western shops. And so those Western shops aren't likely to go into Japan or Korea. Japan being our second biggest market and promote themselves. They're just not going to have a localized product offering. So the countries that have really been successful for this current customer base are the obvious ones, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, et cetera. So English-speaking, similar makeup to the U.S. As we go open up the platform, that's when we'll go try to get local presentation inside Japan, Korea and other markets that are more closed off, but very large markets for us. And in the Western markets, we already have a presence. So it will be faster to get going. I think over time, localization is fortunately not a challenge anymore with LLMs. Language is pretty easy to solve. So we're fairly solved over there. It's just much more built around getting the system to be workable the way we're talking about for the West, goes global, right? Like all users around the world that we see playing games, the human beings behave similarly. They might buy a shot from different shops because there's local merchants in each one of these markets, but humans aren't behaving much differently in Japan or Korea or Canada or Australia to the U.S. So the model translates all human behavior to math. Math is universal. And so as we launch and broaden out the platform, we don't think there's going to be some big lift to really see a lot of success internationally. And we haven't seen that as we've opened up these markets and have these same customers expand out.
Operator: Our next question will come from Martin Yang with Opco.
Martin Yang: Sort of related to the last question, can you maybe talk a bit more about your current cohort, how they have been performed in 3Q? For example, are they more actively spending, given your improvement in tools, having more features, et cetera?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. Look, over the last year, I mean, it's been a year since we've had this product, right? So the team is continuously improving the product. So the return on ad spend for the customers have gotten better. The tooling has gotten better. We went from the old dashboard to the Axon Ads Manager. So the tools that they have at their disposal has gotten better. The customers' understanding of our platform has gotten better. Just that nuance on ad creative that ours are 35 seconds on average, whereas social is 7 seconds. It took months with a lot of customers to explain that fine detail. And that if you're not building a 45-second ad, you're going to lose to your competitor. So all these things just compound. We're 1 year into a product in a very large advertising market, competing with other companies that are years or decade plus into that same market. So as you build better tooling and as you get a better understanding of your tools, you see the effect compounding, the knowledge compounding, the usage compounding. And so we're seeing trends that are positive. But this thing is going to take time to build at the level that we want to build. We've been in the gaming business for 13 years. We're clearly the best channel for the gaming customers at this point. We think we can replicate that success across all these other categories. And as we build to the scale that we're accustomed to operating at, you'd expect a lot of compounding success over time across knowledge, usage and tooling.
Martin Yang: Got it. I have a quick follow-up on the PSU issued in October. That's for engineering employees. Can you maybe give us more context? Is it for a small handful, single recruiting, retention? Any additional details would be helpful.
Matt Stumpf: Yes. It's a pool, Martin, for a group of engineers, but it's also a future tool that we can use for recruiting as well for new hires into the engineering team.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Jim Callahan with Piper Sandler.
James Callahan: I just had a follow-up on the referral codes. I guess, are all the codes so far given out? Or is this something we can expect the partners to sort of continue doing through early 2026?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. Generally, if there's a partner that we gave X codes to and they run through X and they deliver quality leads, we give them more. And we can measure back to every referral partner success of the customers they bring. So we don't want to constrain good referral partners. The gate is solely to slow it down so that we have time to build the tool the way I've been talking about. But if someone is bringing us good leads, we're going to take good leads. So we're going to be dynamic in the codes that we issue across the board if we see success coming in.
James Callahan: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on -- you talked about low quality and like making sure you're selective and having the right kind of advertisers. I guess what would you define as like low quality or an advertiser that wouldn't work sort of with the platform?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. I mean -- so over time, you broaden out the type of advertisers you have to basically everything because you have a lot of density and a customer is never going to see 200 impressions of the same thing. Where we are today, we don't have a lot of density. So in certain categories, a customer may see 200 impressions of the same thing. Well, the bar we set right now is if our team is willing to buy that product or not. If they think it's a good product, they're willing to buy it, great, we want to run it on our platform. That doesn't mean we're going to maintain the same standard forever. Most of the companies that today we call low quality or we're not letting on the platform, they're running ads on social, they're running ads on search. These are real businesses. They're substantial businesses in many cases. But we just want to make sure that we think about our audience as a very consistent large audience, and we want to train them that our ads are really high quality. But in the absence of that competition, if they're getting bombarded with single offers, we want to make sure each one of those is really, really high value for that customer.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Nat Schindler with Scotiabank.
Nathaniel Schindler: I'm going to go really high level and touch back on an earlier question someone asked about whether or not you were interested in some of those Google assets if they ever came up. You're growing at obviously absurd rates and you're doing it to -- it sounds like you're going to continue in your core market in gaming and you're adding obviously e-commerce, which is an enormous opportunity. I assume a lot of this is your conversion rates keep improving. You guys have been great at that over time. But some of it has to do with inventory itself. So at some point, conversion rates can improve too much. And if e-commerce is a lower converting area than gaming, when do you run out of inventory on your core gamer market?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. I mean, look, we don't know is the simple answer. There's a long way to go, we think, just because we have so little advertiser density today. There's never been any company that's been set up like ours in the advertising space in history. Where -- what we reported, I think it was in Q1 was $11 billion plus of ad spend. And then the disclosures we've given you across web advertisers and gaming advertisers puts it in the low thousands. So you've got such a high amount of spend for such a low amount of advertisers across over 1 billion daily active users. Well, what happens when we get more density? You get more data, you get more density, you get more time to improve your models, that conversion rate is going to go up. If you think about social. It's not like there's more users on social. The growth in social has consistently come from the last few years, more customers getting a higher conversion rate because just the technologies are getting more powerful. And so we think we're going to see the same thing, but we're going to be able to pair it with this advertiser recruitment. And we're starting from such a low point, there's going to be quarters, possibly many years of growth in conversion rate to come before we start worrying about supply. Now that said, we've talked about -- it is interesting to us to go help the broader set of publishers, both in the open web and connected TV to better monetize. We get pinged all the time. It's no secret that we're really good at performance advertising at this point. So at some point, we would like to broaden out the supply base as well. Because, why not? That builds a really good growth catalyst into the future. But today, we're really heads down focused on the demand side of the platform because there's so much work to do there. At some point, you'll see us talking about both sides.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session for this quarter. We thank you all for joining us today. Have a good afternoon.
Adam Foroughi: Thanks, everyone.
Matt Stumpf: Thank you.

David Hsiao: Welcome to AppLovin's earnings call for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. I'm David Hsiao, Head of Investor Relations. Joining me today to discuss our results are Adam Foroughi, our Co-Founder, CEO and Chairperson; and Matt Stumpf, our CFO. Please note, our SEC filings to date as well as our financial update and press release discussing our third quarter performance are available at investors.applovin.com. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the future development and reach of our platform, including the expected timing of product launches, our share repurchase program, the efficiency of our operations, the expected future financial performance of the company and other future events. These statements are based on our current assumptions and beliefs, and we assume no obligation to update them, except as required by law. Our actual results may differ materially from the results predicted. We encourage you to review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025. Additional information may also be found in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025, which will be filed today. We will also be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be superior to or a substitute for our GAAP results. Please be sure to review the GAAP results and the reconciliations of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and financial update available on our Investor Relations site. This conference call is being recorded, and a replay will be available for a period of time on our IR website. Now I'll turn it over to Adam and Matt for some opening remarks, then we'll have the moderator take us through Q&A.
Adam Foroughi: Thank you all for joining us today. First, I'd like to recognize our inclusion in the S&P 500, a huge milestone for our company and a strong acknowledgment of what we built. It's a privilege we do not take lightly. It also means we now carry the expectations of a much broader set of investors, and we must push even harder to continue delivering. Turning to our business. Q3 was another very good quarter. Our performance was strong with gaming advertising continuing on a solid trajectory. Our teams delivered multiple incremental lifts in our core models this quarter. And our MAX supply-side platform, one of the best indicators of our end market growth continues to grow at very healthy rates. We also opened up international traffic for advertisers promoting websites or shops in Q3 ahead of schedule. I'm particularly proud of our team because even while executing a strong quarter, we also delivered our major October 1 launch of our self-service platform and referral form. We did so without any significant hiccups, no major bugs and effective filtering out of low-quality ad accounts, something I was personally monitoring closely. This speaks volumes about our ability to automate and execute. I know everyone wants stats on how self-service is going. And instead of something specific around accounts or ramp-up since we're still very early, I'd like to point out a stat which I watch very closely. While it takes a while for new customers to get going, to integrate, to learn how to use our system and to ramp spend, we're already seeing spend from these self-service advertisers grow around roughly 50% week-over-week. It's too soon to be significant, but this type of early growth gives us even more confidence that our platform will excel at being an open platform to any type of advertiser. Our focus for Q4 and 2026 will be the following, with priority always given to improving our models for all advertisers. We'll continue tuning our onboarding flows and ramping more AI agents into the workflow to support a seamless experience for new advertisers. Once we're satisfied with the quality and experience, we'll open the platform broadly beyond referral basis. We'll be testing generative AI-based ad creatives. Over time, if we can move to mostly automated creative generation, we believe user response rates to more customized ads on our platform will materially improve. We are actively testing paid marketing to promote the Axon Ads platform to new customers. We'll continue tuning this acquisition method so that when we launch the platform beyond referral in 2026, we can scale advertiser count without a reliance on a large sales force. If we maintain execution discipline, we are well positioned to acquire a large volume of new advertisers in the coming years. We believe that giving our powerful recommendation engine, a more diverse set of advertisers to recommend will dramatically improve conversion rates, paving the way for elevated growth rates for years to come. It's worth noting the backdrop. The market is recognizing our platform, our scalability and the reach we offer our partners and the institutional dynamics that come with the S&P 500 inclusion are already in motion. At the same time, we continue to operate in an environment of heightened scrutiny around data, privacy and ad tech practices. We remain committed to strict compliance, transparency and execution excellence. To conclude, we delivered a very strong Q3. We are executing on our strategic priorities, and we are confident that our best days are ahead as we broaden access to our self-service platform and scale globally. With that, I'll turn it over to Matt for a deeper dive into the numbers.
Matt Stumpf: Thanks, Adam, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Q3 was another exceptional quarter. Revenue was approximately $1.405 billion, up 68% year-over-year due to model updates in the core gaming business, while adjusted EBITDA was $1.158 billion, up 79% at an 82% margin, up 1% quarter-over-quarter from operating leverage and a modest reduction in operational FX. Quarter-over-quarter flow-through to adjusted EBITDA was 95%, slightly above Q2. Free cash flow was $1.049 billion, up 92% year-over-year. Free cash flow margin improved sequentially given no semiannual cash interest paid on our debt this quarter as those payments occur in Q2 and Q4 of each year. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, we repurchased and withheld approximately 1.3 million shares for $571 million funded by free cash flow. Over the last 3 quarters, we have reduced our weighted average diluted common shares outstanding from 346 million in Q4 of last year to 341 million this quarter. During the quarter, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by an incremental $3.2 billion. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for next quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2025, we anticipate revenue between $1.570 billion and $1.6 billion, reflecting between 12% and 14% sequential growth. With adjusted EBITDA between $1.290 billion and $1.320 billion, targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 82% to 83%. Now with that, let's move to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from James Heaney.
James Heaney: Could you just start off talking about the characteristics of the advertisers that you've onboarded since October 1? Would you say the GMV of the advertisers are smaller than the initial 600 that you had in the pilot? Or are you going down -- more down market? Just any help there would be great.
Adam Foroughi: Yes. Sure, James. They are obviously filtered set of advertisers when we curated the list last year. That was filtered by our team. And then this year, it's filtered through referrals. So these aren't like your local dry cleaner trying to come on to the platform yet. They are predominantly shops. They're not going to be as large as they were in the cohort last year, but they're not going to be materially smaller either. So think of them as comparable in mix. And then it's a broad set of categories. There's no limitation when you're open the way we are through a referral to the type of customer that comes in. So a broad set of shopping categories being represented.
James Heaney: Great. And then just one for Matt. Could you just talk about guidance philosophy for Q4? Just curious how you've used e-com seasonality from last Q4 as a proxy for this year? And just interested to hear kind of what's being assumed from sort of the current customers versus new customers on the e-com side?
Matt Stumpf: Yes, sure. It's not the best comp. Obviously, last year, we had an entirely new e-commerce business that was ramping. And then this quarter, right, we had an existing base. So it's not best comparison year-over-year. So within the guidance, we took an approach where it reflects a combination of different factors that we have going on at the company, obviously, the optimism around the e-commerce referral program, continued model enhancements, the updates that we talked about previously within the Q3 period and then also kind of normal holiday seasonality. So the combination of those factors led to the larger guidance that we're projecting quarter-over-quarter.
Operator: Your next question will come from Omar Dessouky with BofA.
Omar Dessouky: Adam, I wanted to get back to your comments about substantially higher conversion rates. So am I to read that as -- that a significant growth in impressions would not be required to absorb a significant increase in e-commerce advertisers in 2026?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. I mean, look, we've always said we serve a lot of impressions to a lot of users today, over 1 billion users a day. So we're in a world today where the biggest lever for growth on our business, given we report on a net revenue basis is increasing the conversion rate. And that happens from a couple of things. You've got the model enhancements, which we always talk about. Those are super impactful in increasing conversion rate. That's a continuous effort. We are in the very, very beginnings of understanding how to work with neural nets and these AI technologies. I mean if you think about this industry and the core AI industry is only a few years old of engineers really being able to extract this kind of value out of these tools and technologies across a broad range of industries. So as this goes forward, we're going to have consistent incremental improvements and sometimes large, sometimes small, but additive to high impact on driving up conversion rate from technology lifts. Then you're also going to get advertiser density expanding paired with our recommendation system, giving the model the chance to personalize the advertising to the user better. If we have less advertisers and less categories, we just have less to show. So you can't get a diverse set of content to the customer to maximize that conversion rate. Both those things are just going to naturally happen as we go forward. The third piece that I touched on to your phrase you repeated, is that generative AI-based creative. Today, in our advertising system, the advertiser can do almost no targeting. They can pick their country, they can put in their economic goals, they can put in a budget and off they go. The one manual lever is creative. And in particular, in the shopping category or in this like website advertising business, a lot of the customers come on board and they don't have a creative that's adapted for our platform. The average viewership of our ads is roughly 35 seconds. The average viewership of an ad on social is roughly 7 seconds. So a lot of these customers are coming in and just porting a short ad and trying to replicate what they have on social on our platform, and it's mismatched. It diminishes their possible conversion rate. So what does that mean? Well, when we get into a world where we can use generative AI tools to automatically create ad creatives on behalf of these customers, they're going to get to a point where they can actually expand their conversion rate. We're doing nothing more other than just expanding the count of creatives into our system and ensuring that the types of creatives in our system follow best practices on our platform and doing that at no cost. And so we're really excited about where the tools in the marketplace are going. That's something we're going to be testing in short order here.
Omar Dessouky: And if I could just follow up. So you've addressed the conversion rate question I had very clearly. But I did want to touch on how you're thinking about supply, even though, obviously, you've clearly -- you said that the conversion rate is a big driver. So in the past, you've talked about double-digit growth in publisher revenue in MAX, over the past few years. And I'm wondering if you expect that to accelerate as e-commerce ramps. Do you see supply driven primarily by higher ad load as dictated by publishers, higher engagement with mobile games overall or improvements to MAX like those you shipped in 2024? Like which of those factors would be most important?
Adam Foroughi: I mean it's a combination of all of the above. The MAX platform ecosystem is growing really quickly. happens from a couple of different factors. One is, as the ads become higher quality, and we look at e-commerce shopping and just demand density, it's higher quality because the user stops seeing game, game, game, game, game when they're stuck to a game that they actually like. So if you bring more diversity of content, you'd expect retention to go up and ad supply to expand. So that's going to be a natural tailwind inside this ecosystem that will unlock as we get more demand outside of just core advertisers that we have today. Second part of that is what we've talked about in past calls is the unlock of getting these publishers who are in-app purchasing predominantly don't tend to run ads or run ads at a very, very small percentage. If you're monetizing a high LTV game and most of the gaming customers are residing in these deep games, you don't want to run ads for your competition. Well, they didn't have a way to monetize as well as gaming ads in the past. So if we can unlock this material demand shift, then we're going to be able to bring more supply into the ecosystem. That's very advantageous for supply as well. So it's a combination of those 2 things. And then, of course, you've got -- as our models improve, the same customer, that publisher can buy more users that are retained in their game, so they can create more growth in audience, and they'll get better tools as well to better monetize that audience.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Jason Bazinet with Citi.
Jason Bazinet: So a quick question. I appreciate that 50% growth in week-over-week spend from these e-commerce customers. Is there any sort of context you can give us of like when you looked at that same metric during the pilot phase, what was it? Or how do you know that that's a good number or a bad number? I mean it sounds great.
Adam Foroughi: I mean, look, like one of the simpler mathematical functions is extrapolation, right? So like we're starting pretty early here. It's a month in. And it does take a while for these customers to ramp up. Remember, ours is not a plug-and-play solution. They got to come in. They have to integrate pixels. They've got to go live. All of that takes time. So just to get to a point of go-live is a week plus usually. Some can do it very quickly, but it's not common to be able to do it in a day. So you have a period of lag time from October 1 to even a cohort going live. And then this cohort is not as big as what the absolute numbers were that we reported, I think we disclosed in Q1 this year of how big that cohort last year swelled to. But given the ramp-up, the ramp-up is really swift. So we're excited that if this continues to compound at the rate it is and then you keep adding new customers, this thing is going to then snowball on itself. And the true value for us right now is not go, okay, how do we extrapolate this out to when customers in this category become a bigger and bigger part of our business. It's more are we actually building a tool that we have confidence is going to succeed in converting a lot of customers over time. And that breaks down into a few things we look at. Of course, I get excited by seeing scaling spend, but I'm more excited about the fact that we didn't introduce a ton of bucks. We didn't have a bunch of customer complaints. We didn't bring in low-quality advertisers. Anything that was low quality was automatically kicked off the platform. So the team enabled a whole bunch of tools to get a product release that was not immaterial into market in a seamless manner. And now we're in a point of optimization. One point of optimization that's key is when a customer signs up, is it easy for them to understand the value proposition and get through integration to the point of go live. That's something we're really focused on optimizing because as we mentioned, we do want to eventually promote the Axon platform to future customers. And if we want to do that, just like any advertiser in the world, we've got to optimize our conversion funnel. The other piece that's important is our teams are constantly working on embedding tools into the interface, so large language model powered tools that allow the customer to get support without interfacing with us. We're not seeing a huge influx of customer support tickets. We're seeing these customers go live, be able to manage themselves, get best practices extracted out of the tools we've enabled in the dash, and that's fantastic to see. So what I look at when I see this ramp-up is not I'm extrapolating to how is this going to become billions and billions of dollars. It's more that the fact that it's working already a month in, and we're not getting bombarded with customer complaints, and we're not seeing a ton of issues implies that we're on the right track to eventually get open in '26 and really be able to bring in a ton of advertisers over the following quarters and years.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Clark Lampen with BTIG.
William Lampen: Sorry, I have like 4 mute buttons right that I had to take out.
Adam Foroughi: Complex setup over there, Clark.
William Lampen: Right. It's a little too complicated. Okay. So as we're thinking about, I guess, the growth of what has the potential to be like a really big business for you guys over time, billions of incremental as you just sort of talked about. I'm curious how you think about balancing growth, chasing sort of new pockets of potential supply and building up demand to go after that with displacement for your core gaming customer because you are introducing a new bidder with potentially higher transaction value or consumer LTV. Is that something that model improvements and a faster pace of model enhancement will sort of take care of along the way? Or how do you, if any, think about gating the growth of this business if you have to for managing the core -- for the purposes of managing the core?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. I mean, look, one, we don't try to gate growth. So we sort of look at a platform as it's going to develop and evolve as it does. But understanding these models gives me confidence that as we get more density of advertisers, we're actually going to have expanded spend for gaming customers, not diminished spend. And this is a bit counterintuitive, but here's why. The model today, if you go back a year prior to us getting into e-commerce and shops, you ended up having 1,000 impressions to show a user and you bombarded them with games. Well, that's not a great offering. It's as if you had a social network that was showing short-form video and said I'm only going to show golf videos. Everyone who's on the golf videos at that moment would churn. Well, in our case, the customers aren't churning. They're playing games, but they're not going to convert. And our conversion rates are really low. There are moments when the model knows a user is going to be in the game. When those moments happen, the CPM for a game advertiser is phenomenal. It's really, really high. Our average conversion rate is that 1% that we've given a year plus ago. So maybe it's higher now, but just for this example, let's use 1%. We're driving 10 game installs over 1,000 impressions, but we're probably wasting 80%, 90% of those impressions because the model knows in a tight percentage of impressions, games are going to convert, this user is ready for something new and the CPM there will beat anything else that comes along. So you go and bring in demand density. What happens? Now the model can better use all that access impression. And so if it does, what's going to happen is your gaming customer is not going to diminish. It's just going to be more targeted. So maybe impressions go down, CPM goes up for them, but everything is priced to revenue for our customers. So they get the same revenue out. And then these new customers better monetize the user and give them more diversity of content, which hopefully will train them to better engage with our ads. And then you take it to the next level, which is now all of a sudden, we're getting data from way more types of customers. We now know, let's say, tomorrow, someone buys a $5,000 handbag on a website, that's the data point we didn't have a year ago. That data point, my simple mind, can probably tell you that's a good user for Candy Crush if they haven't played Candy Crush. The neural net is going to tell you a lot more than that based on its correlations. And so you're building up a data set that doesn't just limit itself to the shopping category or the website advertising category. It helps enable better advertising for the gaming customers as well. So you put all those pieces together, and I'm really confident that we're not going to squeeze anyone in our platform. We're probably going to have expansion across the board as we add more demand density and get more data into the system.
William Lampen: That's helpful. Maybe just as a very quick follow-up. You guys highlighted tuning the onboarding flows and generative AI creative. How far away are you or sort of at what sort of rate are we making progress to sort of getting one of those tools live? Would either of those things, I guess, be a gating factor to launching or introducing GA at this point? Or are they vital to going to a broader customer base?
Adam Foroughi: So the Axon Ads site is a prompt at this point. And part of the logic of doing that was to get inputs into that prompt, so we can tune a bot that's external facing and then bring it internal. So we're in the midst of doing that, and that's not far off. So we'll have different implementations of bots inside the site. I mean, as you know, and we've talked about last quarter, when a customer uploads ads or uploads a website to promote, we're not manually checking it. There's a bot there that's automatically checking for our quality and ensuring that the quality meets the standard that we need on the platform, both for the creative and for the website being promoted or the application. So we already have various points of bots into the tool, and we'll have more. It's just going to get better as we get more data in, and we can tune it so that it's actually accurate across the board. The generative AI-based ad creatives don't depend entirely on us. But Sora 2 came out this past quarter. That was another step forward. Veo 3 keeps getting better. So you can assume these tools are getting pretty close. We're not -- we're probably far away from the point where the model itself can recursively just go and create more content and just bring more ads into the system. But we're probably not very far away, and I'm hoping, in a matter of weeks or months to be able to test generative AI-based creative that we create with a little help, some tooling on top of the large language models and then submit to the advertisers for approval. That in itself can really explode the count of ads on the platform. And so that's not far off. So on your last question of are these gating to general release, I don't think so. I think the main thing that we care about there is how we tune the flows. Is the conversion funnel appropriate? Are customers getting confused or are they getting a good experience from onboarding to ramping? If they're getting a seamless experience, and we're not getting overly overwhelmed with inbound complaints or concerns or need for support, then we're ready to go open.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alec Brondolo with Wells Fargo.
Alec Brondolo: I appreciate it. I think as we've kind of spoken about direct payments and this transition from kind of paying the App Store and the Play Store 30% to going to an O&O payment product, we've kind of talked about this, I think, historically as more of a medium- to long-term tailwind. Do you think that might be manifesting sooner than expected? And did it contribute to third quarter results?
Adam Foroughi: I don't think it's contributing much at all yet. I think it is going to be over the quarters that it's going to take impact. I don't think it's realistic that 30% tax goes to low single digits. So let's just take the midpoint, 15%. That's a material lift in LTV for a lot of these in-app purchasing games, roughly 20%. Some portion of that is going to go into development of more content, which is great. They're going to make better games. Some portion of that, they'll bank into the bottom line. Some portion of that will go to marketing companies. I mean I'll say the one thing about our business always is we don't try to think about what's happening outside of us. This is something that's outside of our control. It's up to the platforms, regulators and then the content creators. It's not up to us. What's up to us and inside our control is how good our tools are. Q3 was driven by what we said on the earnings script. The models continue to get better, iterative improvements in the template, more advertisements on the platform, more advertisers on the platform, all of that's compounding to really quick growth rate. even in the core category. We're still believing very confidently in this 20% to 30% long-term growth rate in our core category. But even in the core, we're beating that. And then now you're layering on, on top of that, all this opportunity with the self-service platform. So we're really excited about where we are focused on what we have underneath our control.
Alec Brondolo: Perfect. And maybe if I could ask a follow-up. I think there's always been this talk about eventually extending the reach of supply. Like right now, most of the ads are placed in mobile games and then the idea is perhaps over time, we could go to other surfaces. It seems like some combination of AdX and Google Ads Manager might come up for sale as a function of the Google ad tech, antitrust trial. Would you be interested in those assets if they were available?
Adam Foroughi: I mean, without commenting on what else is out there, like commenting about our business, the reality with our business is we think about providing the best solution to our partners. For the advertisers, we believe we're on the track to really give them a good way to access a really large audience playing games. For the game publisher and then expanding publishers as we get to more publishers on our platform, we've built them very good tools to monetize and promote their products and grow their businesses. As we think about going broader than that, the open web publishers and other app publishers that currently can't access our tools the same way could use better monetization. We all know that category is pretty slow growth. And then we talked about CTV in the past, too. Everywhere else is struggling to monetize except in the walled gardens and except on games, predominantly because of the success of our platforms. And so if that's the case, we look at that as our potential prospect clients as well. We should be able to extend our product offering over time to those folks. We need more demand. We're not demand -- we're not supply constrained today, we're demand constrained. But if we do our job right and bring on a lot of advertisers, it serves us well because it serves them well to be able to extend our offering out to more publishers.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vasily Karasyov with Cannonball.
Vasily Karasyov: Adam, I wanted to follow up on what you said earlier about LTV calculations that you think your advertisers do. So if given the variance in growth rates in in-app purchases market and in-app advertising market, right? So can you comment on what you see if the -- your advertisers' LTV calculations are evolving, let's say, compared to a year ago compared to now, I would think that the advertising component would be much higher now, right? Going and how do you -- what it means for you?
Adam Foroughi: So look, generally, as a whole, the in-app purchasing market is more mature than the in-app advertising market. So we're seeing much faster growth rates on the MAX platform. We've said multiples faster than the in-app purchasing market grows because those publishers, both the older publishers in that category are getting better tools, both for growth and monetization. And then newer publishers see these other publishers scaling, so they integrate more ads. So you're seeing more supply come online and existing supply monetize better. In-app purchasing market isn't really creating that many more monetization tools. It requires for growth, this tax to go down if the 30% goes to 15%, that creates a really big tailwind, and it creates better monetization mechanics. That's really hard in that category. It's up to the game developers, but it's not uniform across the platform. And then it requires more IAP games. There's a really big set of games that are just mature in that category that frankly don't really have much of a way to grow anymore. And then there are newer ones that constantly come live. If you look in the top 10 to 20 in-app purchasing -- top grossing games, there's a huge mix of games that have launched in the last 2 years that are now on the top 20. So there's new ones that go live that help grow there. But for us, what we're focused on is where we can drive an impact. We can help the in-app purchasing ones promote themselves. The in-app advertising ones are really exciting for us because they power our true market. The true market is the supply side on MAX. And as we give them better monetization tools and better growth tools, we see that supply expanding. That supply expanding the growth rate there is the direct market that helps us grow. And then hopefully, we can grow on top of that even more because of improvements in all the other parts of our business.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Cost: Thank you for the 50% week-on-week growth metric that is really interesting. Is that the metric that you're managing to try to find the point at which you're going to go general availability? And if not, what are you looking at? Like what will be the things that you need to knock down for that to happen?
Adam Foroughi: All these things take time to build. So I don't like spend -- obviously, if spend wasn't going up a lot, I'd be a lot more concerned when you got a business in any scale growing 50% week-over-week, there's a reason to be excited. But what I care more about is that we have time to optimize the funnel. We need to make sure the conversion funnel is optimized. This is just like launching a B2C property. Your first funnel is not going to be your best funnel. We've already optimized it once. So what's today on the site is better than what was on the site 4 weeks ago. But there's room for improvement there. Your communications with the clients, the e-mails that the potential clients get after they sign up, we can improve that. We can improve the tooling inside the dashboard, all the AI bots that we've talked about. And so there's different aspects of this that we just need time to get to a place where we go, this meets our quality standard, then we're ready to open up. Because if we open up today, we may be okay, we may not. We may get inundated with user concerns as you shrink the size of the advertiser. So one day, I'd like to make sure that, that local laundromat that signs up gets a great experience promoting themselves to this gamer audience on our platform. And if we're not ready yet today, we're going to take our time to get there. We don't think it's a long time away. I think I'd said on our prior earnings call for '26. So this isn't a very long time away. We're just going to take our time to ensure that we've got the product at the level that we want.
Matthew Cost: Great. And then on the paid marketing front, I think you talked last quarter and maybe even mentioned in passing this quarter, the opportunity to do more of that. It looks like based on your sales and marketing budget in the third quarter that it wasn't something that you started to lean into. So how should we think about the timing and potential magnitude of doing more marketing?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. So we're testing right now actively. Testing budget is going to be not large. Even if we ever scale this, the scale of our business is quite large. So like some of the largest advertisers in the world can only spend a couple of hundred million dollars a year. So as you think about the scale of our business, it's never going to be a very large line item against the revenue potential. But because our LTV is so high, and we're optimizing our conversion rate, and we think we can get that to be really compelling and the brand isn't known, the setup is really good for promoting our product to potential end customers. And so -- if that's the case, and we know we have a great LTV to cost of user acquisition, we'll spend. We'll break it out, as it scales, we'll show the unit economics so people can understand what we're doing, but we're really good performance marketers, I think we can all agree at this point. So we're not going to waste money on this. We're not brand marketers. The dollars will be much greater than the dollars we spend on user acquisition. And it's -- for me, it's the full-blown automation of a sales force. We'll need some salespeople, but we can keep a very lean sales team in line with our traditional culture if we can automate onboarding through advertising all the way to point of go live.
Operator: Our next question will come from Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank.
Benjamin Black: Is there any reason to think that the take rate or revenue margin from your e-com spend should be any different to that of the core gaming business? So any structural differences, I guess, to the advertising credits you're offering folks early on, perhaps lower the conversion temporarily. But longer term, are there any differences to be aware of?
Adam Foroughi: No. I mean, look, the advertising credits we offer is such a tiny fraction to overall value of a new customer. So it's no different than like a cost of user acquisition if we got the customer through paid marketing. So it's just really low. So consider that immaterial. The business is not built to, say, web advertising or shops is treated differently than games. It's one unified auction. We're a single platform. So when we get a higher conversion rate, whether that comes from gaming or shops or any category, it's going to have a constant take rate across the board. It just implies that more density equals better conversion rate, possibly higher take.
Benjamin Black: All right. Great. And then second question would be sort of you're clearly growing your ambitions within AI automation more broadly. So maybe talk to us about sort of your investment priorities as we sort of look ahead to the next year. I'd imagine your sort of compute capacity requirements are likely scaling. So sort of how does that play into sort of your expense outlook as we look ahead to the next year?
Adam Foroughi: Yes, we're pay-as-you go. So like I mean, we try to project and buy, in particular, GPUs, that being the more lead time dependent part of the stack. We try to buy those a year in advance. So if you've looked at the financials, you'll see spikes in infrastructure investment, but it runs through the P&L. It's not capitalized, and we do plan it really effectively. And we don't try to really overinvest ahead of revenue. We want to make sure we're really disciplined. And that's completely aligned with our culture where we want to be cost disciplined in every aspect of the business.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Chris Kuntarich with UBS.
Christopher Kuntarich: Hopefully, you can hear me. Just wanted to ask on web-based becoming available to EU advertisers. Any update there? And then, Matt, just a quick follow-up. Are you making any assumptions about advertisers that aren't currently onboarded in the 4Q guide?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. On the EU side, so we can work with EU advertisers today. We just don't open up our inventory for website or shop advertisers in the EU region of our audience. So just a clarification bullet. It's -- EU tends to be somewhere in the low teens percentage of our business, if I remember off the top of my head. So it's not a huge priority versus expanding out the business. GDPR rules are more restrictive and require a build-out for us. So we'll get to it in due time. It's not a priority against getting to general release of our platform and building out the rest of these tools we've talked about.
Matt Stumpf: Yes. And in terms of guidance, I think we've done pretty consistent to our approach thus far. We've communicated before that we guide to kind of where we feel very comfortable that we could potentially land. So we guide to what we know. We don't guide to try to estimate for something that's unpredictable. And in this case, we can't predict the number or the volume of new advertisers coming on to the system through the referral program and how that potential ramp in spend could happen through the quarter. So there is no incremental assumption built into the guide for onboarding of incremental customers.
Operator: Next, we'll hear from Rob Sanderson with Loop Capital.
Robert Sanderson: I have 2. Just in terms of kind of understanding more of the sort of the current points of friction to bringing people on, it sounds like you're doing a lot of work to tune the onboarding flow. But sort of what other points of friction are necessary to address to just further optimize? And then you've also said that you're not seeing a ton of complaints, but I'm sure you are getting asks for features and things. So maybe what are some common sort of asks for feature add to Axon Ads Manager?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. So the first question, I mean, like you've got 2 points of this funnel, pre getting-to-us. So eventually, we've got to get the brand out there. We got to be able to market the platform. We've got to -- we're constrained by how many referral codes we gave out. So like just advertisers coming to the Axon platform and signing up. So let's set that aside because we purposefully constrained that. After the sign-up, we want to make sure we have as little drop-off as possible. Of course, with any product, when you get a sign-up, not every sign-up is going to be qualified, but we think a lot of these are qualified. So we're optimizing to as high a rate as we can from sign-up to go live. In terms of feature requests, surprisingly, not a whole lot. This is like, I would say, hard to guarantee that it will be that going forward because we're only a month in. So like if there's a lag time to integration and ramp up, and we're seeing the swift growth, you don't have time for these customers to really understand the platform yet. So that may change, but we get more feature requests from our current cohort of customers, the ones that went live a year ago, much more so than what we brought on in the last month.
Robert Sanderson: If I could ask on international. You mentioned that you launched a little early. And it sounds like no EU. So maybe where are you available? Anything surprising or different about the behavior from this cohort? And then just anything you can share on next steps to expanding? I mean, you probably have some language optimization to do, I'm sure, and channel development work, but kind of what are -- sort of what are some of the next steps to make international a much bigger component?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. So first off, it's everywhere in the world, except for EU traffic for web shops and web advertisers. App advertisers are everywhere in the world. We don't operate inside China, so -- but the rest of the world is there. In our business, the customers that we have today are mostly Western shops. And so those Western shops aren't likely to go into Japan or Korea. Japan being our second biggest market and promote themselves. They're just not going to have a localized product offering. So the countries that have really been successful for this current customer base are the obvious ones, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, et cetera. So English-speaking, similar makeup to the U.S. As we go open up the platform, that's when we'll go try to get local presentation inside Japan, Korea and other markets that are more closed off, but very large markets for us. And in the Western markets, we already have a presence. So it will be faster to get going. I think over time, localization is fortunately not a challenge anymore with LLMs. Language is pretty easy to solve. So we're fairly solved over there. It's just much more built around getting the system to be workable the way we're talking about for the West, goes global, right? Like all users around the world that we see playing games, the human beings behave similarly. They might buy a shot from different shops because there's local merchants in each one of these markets, but humans aren't behaving much differently in Japan or Korea or Canada or Australia to the U.S. So the model translates all human behavior to math. Math is universal. And so as we launch and broaden out the platform, we don't think there's going to be some big lift to really see a lot of success internationally. And we haven't seen that as we've opened up these markets and have these same customers expand out.
Operator: Our next question will come from Martin Yang with Opco.
Martin Yang: Sort of related to the last question, can you maybe talk a bit more about your current cohort, how they have been performed in 3Q? For example, are they more actively spending, given your improvement in tools, having more features, et cetera?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. Look, over the last year, I mean, it's been a year since we've had this product, right? So the team is continuously improving the product. So the return on ad spend for the customers have gotten better. The tooling has gotten better. We went from the old dashboard to the Axon Ads Manager. So the tools that they have at their disposal has gotten better. The customers' understanding of our platform has gotten better. Just that nuance on ad creative that ours are 35 seconds on average, whereas social is 7 seconds. It took months with a lot of customers to explain that fine detail. And that if you're not building a 45-second ad, you're going to lose to your competitor. So all these things just compound. We're 1 year into a product in a very large advertising market, competing with other companies that are years or decade plus into that same market. So as you build better tooling and as you get a better understanding of your tools, you see the effect compounding, the knowledge compounding, the usage compounding. And so we're seeing trends that are positive. But this thing is going to take time to build at the level that we want to build. We've been in the gaming business for 13 years. We're clearly the best channel for the gaming customers at this point. We think we can replicate that success across all these other categories. And as we build to the scale that we're accustomed to operating at, you'd expect a lot of compounding success over time across knowledge, usage and tooling.
Martin Yang: Got it. I have a quick follow-up on the PSU issued in October. That's for engineering employees. Can you maybe give us more context? Is it for a small handful, single recruiting, retention? Any additional details would be helpful.
Matt Stumpf: Yes. It's a pool, Martin, for a group of engineers, but it's also a future tool that we can use for recruiting as well for new hires into the engineering team.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Jim Callahan with Piper Sandler.
James Callahan: I just had a follow-up on the referral codes. I guess, are all the codes so far given out? Or is this something we can expect the partners to sort of continue doing through early 2026?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. Generally, if there's a partner that we gave X codes to and they run through X and they deliver quality leads, we give them more. And we can measure back to every referral partner success of the customers they bring. So we don't want to constrain good referral partners. The gate is solely to slow it down so that we have time to build the tool the way I've been talking about. But if someone is bringing us good leads, we're going to take good leads. So we're going to be dynamic in the codes that we issue across the board if we see success coming in.
James Callahan: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on -- you talked about low quality and like making sure you're selective and having the right kind of advertisers. I guess what would you define as like low quality or an advertiser that wouldn't work sort of with the platform?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. I mean -- so over time, you broaden out the type of advertisers you have to basically everything because you have a lot of density and a customer is never going to see 200 impressions of the same thing. Where we are today, we don't have a lot of density. So in certain categories, a customer may see 200 impressions of the same thing. Well, the bar we set right now is if our team is willing to buy that product or not. If they think it's a good product, they're willing to buy it, great, we want to run it on our platform. That doesn't mean we're going to maintain the same standard forever. Most of the companies that today we call low quality or we're not letting on the platform, they're running ads on social, they're running ads on search. These are real businesses. They're substantial businesses in many cases. But we just want to make sure that we think about our audience as a very consistent large audience, and we want to train them that our ads are really high quality. But in the absence of that competition, if they're getting bombarded with single offers, we want to make sure each one of those is really, really high value for that customer.
Operator: We'll take our last question from Nat Schindler with Scotiabank.
Nathaniel Schindler: I'm going to go really high level and touch back on an earlier question someone asked about whether or not you were interested in some of those Google assets if they ever came up. You're growing at obviously absurd rates and you're doing it to -- it sounds like you're going to continue in your core market in gaming and you're adding obviously e-commerce, which is an enormous opportunity. I assume a lot of this is your conversion rates keep improving. You guys have been great at that over time. But some of it has to do with inventory itself. So at some point, conversion rates can improve too much. And if e-commerce is a lower converting area than gaming, when do you run out of inventory on your core gamer market?
Adam Foroughi: Yes. I mean, look, we don't know is the simple answer. There's a long way to go, we think, just because we have so little advertiser density today. There's never been any company that's been set up like ours in the advertising space in history. Where -- what we reported, I think it was in Q1 was $11 billion plus of ad spend. And then the disclosures we've given you across web advertisers and gaming advertisers puts it in the low thousands. So you've got such a high amount of spend for such a low amount of advertisers across over 1 billion daily active users. Well, what happens when we get more density? You get more data, you get more density, you get more time to improve your models, that conversion rate is going to go up. If you think about social. It's not like there's more users on social. The growth in social has consistently come from the last few years, more customers getting a higher conversion rate because just the technologies are getting more powerful. And so we think we're going to see the same thing, but we're going to be able to pair it with this advertiser recruitment. And we're starting from such a low point, there's going to be quarters, possibly many years of growth in conversion rate to come before we start worrying about supply. Now that said, we've talked about -- it is interesting to us to go help the broader set of publishers, both in the open web and connected TV to better monetize. We get pinged all the time. It's no secret that we're really good at performance advertising at this point. So at some point, we would like to broaden out the supply base as well. Because, why not? That builds a really good growth catalyst into the future. But today, we're really heads down focused on the demand side of the platform because there's so much work to do there. At some point, you'll see us talking about both sides.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session for this quarter. We thank you all for joining us today. Have a good afternoon.
Adam Foroughi: Thanks, everyone.
Matt Stumpf: Thank you.

Financials‑vs‑History note:
English

Direct comparison
- 2024-Q3 — Total Revenue: "$1.2 billion"
  - Comparison: Current metric is "Early self-service advertiser spend growth = ~50% week‑over‑week." This is a short‑term adoption/growth rate and is not directly comparable to a quarterly revenue number. Similarity: both indicate strong demand. Difference: revenue is an aggregate quarterly dollar result; the 50% WoW figure is an early growth velocity metric. Verdict: not directly comparable.

- 2024-Q3 — Adjusted EBITDA: "$722 million"
  - Comparison: Current quarter adjusted EBITDA (related bottom‑line proxy) is "$1.158 billion" (2025‑Q3). Difference: current adjusted EBITDA is materially higher in absolute dollars. The 50% WoW self‑service spend is an upstream demand signal that could help sustain EBITDA growth; direct comparison is not apples‑to‑apples. Verdict: current adjusted EBITDA is higher.

- 2024-Q3 — Revenue Increase: "39%"
  - Comparison: Current Q3 2025 Revenue growth is "up 68% year‑over‑year." The company’s current YoY revenue growth (68%) is substantially higher than the 39% YoY reported in 2024‑Q3, showing acceleration in topline growth consistent with strong early advertiser spend trends. The 50% WoW self‑service growth supports this acceleration but is not a direct quarter‑over‑year metric. Verdict: current YoY revenue growth is higher.

- 2024-Q3 — Adjusted EBITDA Increase: "72%"
  - Comparison: Current Q3 2025 adjusted EBITDA growth is "up 79%." Current YoY adjusted EBITDA growth (79%) is modestly higher than the prior 72% YoY, indicating continued bottom‑line improvement; the early self‑service advertiser 50% WoW is one contributor to demand, but again it's a different cadence. Verdict: current YoY adjusted EBITDA growth is higher.

- 2024-Q3 — Flow‑Through from Revenue to Adjusted EBITDA: "91%"
  - Comparison: Current Q3 2025 EBITDA flow‑through is "95%, slightly above Q2." This is higher than the 91% flow‑through referenced for 2024‑Q3, indicating improved conversion of incremental revenue to EBITDA. The 50% WoW early self‑service spend supports top‑line expansion that appears to be converting efficiently to EBITDA. Verdict: current flow‑through is higher.

- 2024-Q3 — Free Cash Flow: "$545 million"
  - Comparison: Current Q3 2025 Free Cash Flow is "$1.049 billion, up 92% year‑over‑year." In absolute terms current FCF is much higher ($1.049B vs $545M). In YoY growth rate, current FCF growth (92%) is lower than the anomalously high prior quoted YoY increase of 182% (2024‑Q3), but absolute FCF has improved materially. Verdict: current absolute FCF is higher; YoY% is lower than that prior spike.

- 2024-Q3 — Free Cash Flow Growth (quarter‑over‑quarter): "22%"
  - Comparison: Current quarter indicates strong sequential FCF behavior (improved margin sequentially). The current absolute FCF and FCF margin improvement (driven partly by no semiannual cash interest) show better cash generation compared with typical prior quarters. Direct QoQ percentages are not provided for Q3 2025 here, so exact QoQ comparison is not available. Verdict: current FCF performance is stronger in absolute terms; QoQ comparison not directly stated.

- 2024-Q3 — Cash and Cash Equivalents: "$568 million"
  - Comparison: Current Q3 2025 cash balance is "$1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents." Current cash is materially higher than the $568M reported in 2024‑Q3, reflecting stronger cash generation and/or balance‑sheet improvement. Verdict: current cash balance is higher.

- 2024-Q3 — Software Platform Revenue: "$835 million"
  - Comparison: Current topline drivers include "model updates in the core gaming business" and broad revenue growth to $1.405B. The 50% WoW growth in early self‑service spend is an adoption signal that complements platform revenue growth; not directly comparable metric types. Verdict: not directly comparable; current total/platform revenue is higher.

- 2024-Q3 — Software Platform Adjusted EBITDA: "$653 million" (78% margin) and related Growth: "79%"
  - Comparison: Current overall adjusted EBITDA is $1.158B at an 82% margin (up 1% QoQ). Absolute and margin outcomes are stronger now versus the platform figure cited for 2024‑Q3. Verdict: current adjusted EBITDA and margin are higher.

- 2024‑Q4 — Adjusted EBITDA Q4 2024: "$848 million"
  - Comparison: Current adjusted EBITDA $1.158B is higher than $848M (Q4 2024). Verdict: current adjusted EBITDA is higher.

- 2024‑Q3 — Return on Ad Spend from E‑commerce Pilot: "Nearly 100% incrementality"
  - Comparison: The nearly 100% incrementality result in the pilot suggests high ROI for advertisers; the reported 50% WoW growth among self‑service advertisers is consistent with attractive ROI driving advertiser spend. Not a direct dollar/percentage comparison, but operationally aligned. Verdict: directionally consistent.

Overall similarities, differences, and trends (bottom‑line focus)
- Similarities: Management’s qualitative points (new advertiser adoption, high incrementality, improving conversion) align with the observed numbers: strong revenue growth, rising adjusted EBITDA and margins, high flow‑through, and materially higher free cash flow and cash balances.
- Differences/trends: Top‑line acceleration — YoY revenue grew 68% in 2025‑Q3 vs 39% in 2024‑Q3 — and bottom‑line improvement — adjusted EBITDA rose to $1.158B (79% YoY) vs $722M previously (72% YoY) — show sustained improvement in profitability. Flow‑through improved from ~91% to 95%, and FCF in absolute dollars roughly doubled ($545M → $1.049B). Cash on hand rose materially ($568M → $1.7B). The early self‑service 50% WoW growth is an early, high‑frequency signal consistent with these accelerating financials but is not directly comparable to quarterly aggregates.

Supported outcomes (where management explicitly referenced historical comparisons)
- Management said EBITDA margin and flow‑through improved versus prior quarters (explicitly: "Quarter‑over‑quarter flow‑through to adjusted EBITDA was 95%, slightly above Q2" and margin "82% margin, up 1% quarter‑over‑quarter"). Supported by facts: flow‑through = 95% (current) vs 91% (previous reference) and adjusted EBITDA margin up to 82% (from lower mid‑70s/60% in earlier quarters), confirming improved conversion of revenue to bottom‑line.
- Management attributed revenue growth to "model updates in the core gaming business" and cited top‑line acceleration (revenue up 68% YoY). Supported by comparisons to prior YoY revenue growth (39% in 2024‑Q3): numbers confirm a material acceleration in revenue that aligns with early self‑service advertiser spend momentum.
- Management noted improved free cash flow margin "given no semiannual cash interest paid" and reported FCF $1.049B (up 92% YoY). Supported by the comparison to prior FCF ($545M), confirming stronger cash generation and margin benefit this quarter.
- Overall bottom‑line improvement is supported: adjusted EBITDA absolute and YoY growth are higher versus the similar prior quarter (79% YoY / $1.158B vs 72% YoY / $722M), and cash/FCF metrics corroborate improved profitability and cash conversion.

  - 比較: 該試點顯示高 ROI；早期自助廣告主每週 50% 的支出成長與高增量性一致，說明廣告效果好、廣告主願意加碼投入。不是直接金額/百分比比較，但在運營上相符。判斷：方向性一致。

整體相似處、差異與趨勢（底線重點）
- 相似處：管理層的質性說法（新廣告主採用、高增量、提升轉化）與觀察到的數字一致：營收強勁、調整後 EBITDA 與利潤率上升、流轉率高，自由現金流與現金餘額顯著改善。
- 差異/趨勢：營收加速 — 2025‑Q3 年增 68% vs 2024‑Q3 年增 39%；底線改善 — 調整後 EBITDA 增至 $1.158B（YoY +79%） vs 先前 $722M（YoY +72%）。流轉率從約 91% 提升至 95%；自由現金流絕對值近乎翻倍（$545M → $1.049B）；現金持有顯著提升（$568M → $1.7B）。早期自助廣告 50% WoW 的成長為高頻率信號，支持上述財務加速，但與季度彙總數字不能做直接比較。

支持的結論（管理層有明確提到且數字證實）
- 管理層提到 EBITDA 利潤率與流轉率相比先前有所改善（明言："Quarter‑over‑quarter flow‑through to adjusted EBITDA was 95%, slightly above Q2"；利潤率 "82% margin, up 1% quarter‑over‑quarter"）。事實支持：本季流轉率 95% 高於先前約 91%，利潤率提高，證實收入向底線的轉化改善。
- 管理層將營收成長歸因於「核心遊戲業務的模型更新」，並報告營收年增 68%。與 2024‑Q3 的 39% YoY 相比，數字證實營收確有顯著加速，與早期自助廣告支出動能一致。
- 管理層指出自由現金流利潤率改善部分來自「本季沒有支付半年期現金利息」，並報告 FCF $1.049B（YoY +92%）。這與先前 FCF $545M 的比較一致，證實本季現金產出與利潤率改善。
- 底線整體改善獲支持：當前調整後 EBITDA 絕對值與 YoY 增幅（$1.158B / +79%）均高於先前（$722M / +72%），並由現金/FCF 指標進一步佐證。

Historical‑Calls note:
English

1) Validate past forward-looking guidance (met / beat / missed vs. 2025‑Q3)
- Long‑term core gaming growth target (20%–30%): BEAT. Management previously said they “believe very confidently in this 20% to 30% long‑term growth rate.” In 2025‑Q3 revenue was up 68% year‑over‑year (Revenue = $1.405B), well above the prior 20%–30% expectation.
- E‑commerce general‑availability timing (“next year” from 2024‑Q3): MISSED / DELAYED. Prior guidance targeted general availability “next year” (i.e., 2025); current commentary now indicates broader/general availability in 2026.
- Self‑service dashboard launch (planned “this quarter for select customers” in 2025‑Q1): MISSED / DELAYED. Prior commentary expected a launch in 2025‑Q1 for select customers; the firm reports delivering a major October 1 launch (no major bugs) — a later date (Oct 1) than the earlier plan.

(If a prior forward‑looking item did not have a directly comparable 2025‑Q3 outcome in the transcript/facts, it is omitted.)

2) Compare results discussed (concrete numbers)
- Revenue: Prior reported/reference revenue (2024‑Q3) ≈ $1.2B; 2025‑Q3 actual revenue = $1.405B, up 68% year‑over‑year.
- Adjusted EBITDA and margin: Prior adjusted EBITDA (2024‑Q3) $722M at ~60% margin; 2025‑Q3 adjusted EBITDA = $1.158B, up 79% YoY at an 82% margin (up 1% q/q).
- Flow‑through: Prior flow‑through reference ~91% (earlier quarter); 2025‑Q3 quarter‑over‑quarter flow‑through to adjusted EBITDA = 95% (slightly above Q2).
- Free cash flow: Prior free cash flow (2024‑Q3) $545M; 2025‑Q3 free cash flow = $1.049B, up 92% YoY.
- Share repurchases / share count trend: Prior buyback authorization = $2.3B (2024‑Q3); 2025‑Q3 repurchases/withholdings ≈ 1.3M shares for $571M funded by free cash flow; weighted average diluted shares have fallen from 346M (Q4 prior year) to 341M in 2025‑Q3 (with 342M reported in 2025‑Q2).
- Core gaming as growth driver: Prior commentary (2025‑Q2 / earlier) said the gaming segment accounted for the majority of growth; 2025‑Q3 management attributes the +68% YoY revenue to “model updates in the core gaming business.”
- Ad engagement: Prior engagement context noted very large mobile‑game audiences; 2025‑Q3 reports average ad viewership ≈ 35 seconds on their platform vs ~7 seconds on social.

3) Supporting evidence (historical statement → matching 2025‑Q3 result)
• Long‑term growth target: “We're still believing very confidently in this 20% to 30% long‑term growth rate in our core category.” → 2025‑Q3 revenue was up 68% YoY (Revenue ≈ $1.405B).  
• E‑commerce GA timing: “E‑commerce General Availability: ‘Next year.’” → Current commentary: targeting broader/general availability in 2026 (delay).  
• Self‑service launch timing: “Upcoming launch of self‑service dashboard: ‘Launching this quarter for select customers’ (2025‑Q1).” → The company reports delivering the major October 1 self‑service platform/referral launch (no major bugs) (later date).  
• Revenue baseline: “Total Revenue: ‘$1.2 billion’ (2024‑Q3).” → 2025‑Q3 Revenue: “approximately $1.405 billion, up 68% year‑over‑year.”  
• Adjusted EBITDA: “Adjusted EBITDA: ‘$722 million’ (2024‑Q3, ~60% margin).” → 2025‑Q3 adjusted EBITDA: “$1.158 billion, up 79% at an 82% margin.”  
• Flow‑through: “Flow‑through from revenue to adjusted EBITDA: ‘91%’ (prior reference).” → 2025‑Q3: “Quarter‑over‑quarter flow‑through to adjusted EBITDA was 95%.”  
• Free cash flow: “Free cash flow: ‘$545 million’ (2024‑Q3).” → 2025‑Q3 free cash flow: “$1.049 billion, up 92% year‑over‑year.”  
• Share buyback authority → repurchases: “Share buyback authorization: ‘$2.3 billion’ (2024‑Q3).” → 2025‑Q3: “we repurchased and withheld approximately 1.3 million shares for $571 million funded by free cash flow.”  
• Share count trend: “Share count: ‘342 million shares this quarter’ (2025‑Q2).” → 2025‑Q3: “reduced weighted average diluted common shares outstanding from 346 million in Q4 of last year to 341 million this quarter.”  
• Core gaming driver: “Majority of our growth came from the gaming segment (prior quarters).” → 2025‑Q3: “Revenue was... up 68% year‑over‑year due to model updates in the core gaming business.”  
• Ad engagement: “User engagement: ‘Over 1 billion people in mobile games daily’ (prior).” → 2025‑Q3: “The average viewership of our ads is roughly 35 seconds. The average viewership of an ad on social is roughly 7 seconds.”

1) 驗證過去的前瞻性指引（達成 / 超越 / 未達，對照 2025‑Q3）
- 核心遊戲長期成長目標（20%–30%）：超越。管理層先前表示「對於這 20% 到 30% 的長期成長率仍然非常有信心。」但 2025‑Q3 營收年增為 68%（營收 = $1.405B），遠高於先前 20%–30% 的預期。  
- 電商全面上線時程（2024‑Q3 說「明年」）：未達 / 延後。先前預期全面上線「明年」（即 2025）；目前說法改為在 2026 年才會更廣泛上線。  
- 自助廣告儀表板上線（2025‑Q1 說「本季推出給部分客戶」）：未達 / 延後。先前預期在 2025‑Q1 向部分客戶推出；公司報告實際在 10 月 1 日交付重大上線（無重大 BUG），日期晚於先前計畫。

（若先前的前瞻性項目無法直接與 2025‑Q3 結果比對，則省略。）

2) 比較討論中的結果（具體數字）
- 營收：先前報告/參考 2024‑Q3 營收約 $1.2B；2025‑Q3 實際營收 = $1.405B，年增 68%。  
- 調整後 EBITDA 與利率：先前 2024‑Q3 調整後 EBITDA $722M，約 60% 利率；2025‑Q3 調整後 EBITDA = $1.158B，年增 79%，利率 82%（較 Q2 上升 1%）。  
- 流向（flow‑through）：先前參考約 91%；2025‑Q3 季度間流向到調整後 EBITDA = 95%（略高於 Q2）。

- 核心遊戲為成長驅動：先前（2025‑Q2/更早）表示遊戲業務為成長主力；2025‑Q3 管理層表示 +68% 年增之營收是因「核心遊戲業務的模型更新」。  
- 廣告參與度：先前提到行動遊戲的龐大用戶基數；2025‑Q3 報告其平台廣告平均觀看時間約 35 秒，社群平台約 7 秒。

3) 支撐證據（歷史陳述 → 對應 2025‑Q3 結果）
• 長期成長目標：「We're still believing very confidently in this 20% to 30% long‑term growth rate in our core category.」→ 2025‑Q3 營收年增 68%（營收 ≈ $1.405B）。

Peers note:
English

- Early self-service advertiser spend growth:
  - How APP differs: APP reports extremely rapid early traction from new self‑service advertisers — "roughly 50% week‑over‑week" growth — framing it as an exponential onboarding ramp that will compound quickly.
  - Evidence from peers: Comparable firms framed advertiser/ads growth more conservatively as quarterly/yearly percentages (e.g., EXPE "25%" advertising revenue growth in 2024‑Q4; TTD described "Increasing performance‑driven spending" in 2025‑Q2). APP emphasizes short‑term weekly ramping rather than the quarterly trends peers cite (EXPE 2024‑Q4; TTD 2025‑Q2).

- Q3 2025 Revenue:
  - How APP differs: APP reported a very high single‑quarter growth rate and dollar scale: "approximately $1.405 billion, up 68% year‑over‑year," highlighting both pace and absolute size.
  - Evidence from peers: Peer references show more modest or differently framed revenue points (AKAM $1.055B Q3‑2025; HOOD "nearly $1.3 billion" Q3‑2025). APP's combination of large dollar amount and high YoY growth outpaces these peer examples (AKAM 2025‑Q3; HOOD 2025‑Q3).

- Q3 2025 Adjusted EBITDA:
  - How APP differs: APP reports an exceptionally high adjusted EBITDA and margin — "$1.158 billion, up 79% at an 82% margin" — emphasizing very high profitability and margin expansion.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers reported much smaller absolute EBITDA or lower margins (HSIC $295M Q3‑2025; EXPE $1.4B but at a 33% margin Q3‑2025). APP stresses unusually high margin (82%), which is materially above the margins cited for comparable firms (HSIC 2025‑Q3; EXPE 2025‑Q3).

- Q3 2025 EBITDA flow‑through:
  - How APP differs: APP highlights very strong sequential flow‑through to EBITDA — "95%, slightly above Q2" — implying tight operating leverage on incremental revenue.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers typically discuss growth or margins but not such high quarter‑to‑quarter flow‑through rates; available examples focus on EBITDA level/margin rather than flow‑through (EXPE Q3‑2025 adjusted EBITDA metrics). APP's emphasis on 95% flow‑through is a more operational, near‑term efficiency claim versus peers' more general EBITDA reporting (EXPE 2025‑Q3).

- Q3 2025 Free Cash Flow:
  - How APP differs: APP reports very large free cash generation and strong YoY growth: "$1.049 billion, up 92% year‑over‑year," linking profitability to cash conversion.
  - Evidence from peers: Peer free cash flow examples vary and are generally smaller in these excerpts (FISV $1.3B Q3‑2025 is similar scale but other peers show much smaller FCF like BAX $126M Q3‑2025). APP emphasizes both high absolute FCF and high YoY improvement (FISV 2025‑Q3; BAX 2025‑Q3).

- Q3 2025 cash balance:
  - How APP differs: APP ended with "$1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents," presented as a solid but not outsized cash position relative to its reported profit/cash flow.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers show a range of cash balances (PODD $1.3B Q1‑2025; DXCM > $3.3B Q3‑2025; SMCI $2.54B Q3‑2025). APP's $1.7B is mid‑range versus these historical peer examples (PODD 2025‑Q1; DXCM 2025‑Q3).

- Q4 2025 Revenue guidance:
  - How APP differs: APP gives a high single‑quarter sequential growth target "between $1.570B and $1.6B" (12–14% sequential growth), projecting continued acceleration into the next quarter.
  - Evidence from peers: Peer guidance examples are often tighter or at different magnitudes (PLTR guided $1.327B–$1.331B Q4‑2025; DDOG $912M–$916M for Q4). APP's guidance implies stronger sequential acceleration than the peer ranges cited (PLTR 2025‑Q3; DDOG 2025‑Q3).

- Q4 2025 Adjusted EBITDA guidance:
  - How APP differs: APP targets very high absolute adjusted EBITDA with sustained top‑tier margins — "$1.290B–$1.320B" and "82%–83% margin" — projecting margin stability at an unusually high level.
  - Evidence from peers: Peer EBITDA guidance/targets show lower absolute margins or different framing (PAYC full‑year guidance with much lower margins; AXON guidance with 25% margins). APP's 82–83% target is materially higher than the peer examples (PAYC 2024‑Q4; AXON 2024‑Q4).

- Current daily user reach:
  - How APP differs: APP emphasizes massive daily reach "over 1 billion users a day," using scale as a driver for ad monetization.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers report varied MAU/DAU metrics (META "3.4 billion" daily app reach in 2025‑Q2; DASH "tens of millions" monthly). APP's "over 1 billion daily" is large but framed against peers' different reach metrics — APP centers daily reach specifically for ad impressions (META 2025‑Q2; DASH 2024‑Q2).

- Average ad viewership duration on their platform vs social:
  - How APP differs: APP claims much higher ad attention — "roughly 35 seconds" vs social "roughly 7 seconds" — using engagement differential to justify higher ad value.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers discuss increases in video time spent but not such a direct platform-to‑social time comparison (META referenced double‑digit video time growth; TTWO and others report play time or video time increases). APP's explicit per‑ad view duration delta is a stronger, proprietary engagement claim than the aggregate time trends peers cite (META 2024‑Q4/2025‑Q3; TTWO 2024‑Q4).

- Current geographic availability for web/shop inventory:
  - How APP differs: APP discloses a deliberate inventory restriction in the EU — "we can work with EU advertisers today. We just don't open up our inventory for website or shop advertisers in the EU... EU tends to be somewhere in the low teens percentage of our business" — highlighting a controlled, regionally constrained rollout.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers cite geographic variation or market stagnation (HPE "Geographic variation" Q4‑2024; PLTR "Stagnant Europe" 2025‑Q3). APP's explicit policy of not opening certain EU inventory is a more specific operational limitation than the broader market comments from peers (HPE 2024‑Q3; PLTR 2025‑Q3).

- MAX SSP growth in Q3 2025:
  - How APP differs: APP states MAX supply‑side platform "continues to grow at very healthy rates," positioning an internal platform as a primary, fast‑growing monetization engine.
  - Evidence from peers: Peer platform growth commentary ranges from modest (“mid‑single digits” GDDY) to very positive (MPWR "very high" demand). APP's qualitative "very healthy" aligns with optimistic peer language but APP ties it to in‑app ad monetization specifically (GDDY 2025‑Q3; MPWR 2024‑Q3).

- Regulatory and scrutiny environment:
  - How APP differs: APP explicitly calls out "heightened scrutiny around data, privacy and ad tech practices" as an ongoing operational environment, embedding regulatory risk into current operations.
  - Evidence from peers: Multiple peers similarly flag regulatory risks (ANET "Subject to risks and uncertainties" 2024‑Q1; HOOD and NVDA referencing monitoring regulatory developments). APP's wording is consistent with peers but is notable because it directly links to ad tech practices rather than general compliance risk (ANET 2024‑Q1; HOOD 2023‑Q4; NVDA 2024‑Q2).

- Institutional dynamics from S&P 500 inclusion:
  - How APP differs: APP notes "institutional dynamics that come with the S&P 500 inclusion are already in motion," treating index inclusion as an immediate capital‑markets tailwind.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers reference institutional demand or trading incentives in different contexts (ALLE "Favorable long‑term demand" 2024‑Q1; COIN "Continue investments in trading incentives" 2025‑Q1). APP frames index inclusion as a current institutional driver rather than a gradual effect, giving more weight to immediate flows (ALLE 2024‑Q1; COIN 2025‑Q1).

- Data/privacy/ad‑tech regulatory backdrop:
  - How APP differs: APP repeats the heightened scrutiny theme specifically for data/privacy/ad‑tech, aligning product availability and go‑to‑market with that backdrop.
  - Evidence from peers: TTD and others describe the ad ecosystem as "evolving rapidly with ongoing regulatory scrutiny" or "ongoing scrutiny of walled gardens." APP's stance mirrors those peers but couples the risk statement to operational inventory decisions earlier in the call (TTD 2025‑Q2; TTD 2025‑Q1).

- Expected long‑term core gaming growth rate:
  - How APP differs: APP is confident in an outsized long‑term growth outlook for its core category — "20% to 30% long‑term growth" — which is materially higher than several peer long‑term targets.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers project more modest long‑term growth (GDDY "mid‑single digits"/"low single digits"; KEYS "5% to 7%"). APP's 20–30% target is substantially more aggressive than these historical peer expectations (GDDY 2024‑Q4; KEYS 2025‑Q1).

- Impact of reduced app‑store tax on LTV and spend:
  - How APP differs: APP anticipates that a cut (e.g., "30% goes to 15%") would be "a material lift in LTV" and that "some portion... will go to marketing companies," projecting direct monetization/marketing upside from policy change.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers discuss regulatory/tax impacts in more cautious or modest terms (ZBRA "Constructive for some U.S. customers"; LLY "Modest" tariff impacts). APP's view is explicitly optimistic and tied to user LTV and marketing spend reallocation, a more direct commercialization read than peers' guarded commentary (ZBRA 2025‑Q2; LLY 2025‑Q2).

- Maturity difference between IAP and in‑app advertising markets:
  - How APP differs: APP states the in‑app purchasing market is more mature and that in‑app advertising (MAX) is growing "much faster," using that contrast to justify accelerated MAX growth vs IAP.
  - Evidence from peers: Peers note shifts to ad‑funded models or evolving digital ads landscapes (TTD "Increased ad‑funded subscriptions"; TTD/other comments on rapid evolution). APP frames a relative market‑maturity gap as a structural growth opportunity for its ad platform, consistent with but more specific than peers' general market observations (TTD 2023‑Q4; TTD 2025‑Q2).

- 早期自助廣告主支出成長：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 報告新的自助廣告主獲得極快的早期成長──「大約每週成長 50%」，把它描述為會迅速複利增長的指標性上線速度。
  - 歷史通話證據：可比公司較多以較保守的季度/年度百分比來表述廣告成長（例如 EXPE 在 2024‑Q4「25%」廣告營收成長；TTD 在 2025‑Q2 談到「Increasing performance‑driven spending」）。APP 強調每週的短期加速，而非同業常用的季度趨勢（EXPE 2024‑Q4；TTD 2025‑Q2）。

- 2025 年第 3 季營收：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 報告非常高的單季成長與規模：「約 $1.405B，年增 68%」，同時突出成長速度與絕對金額。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業範例顯示較溫和或不同呈現方式的營收（AKAM Q3‑2025 $1.055B；HOOD Q3‑2025「nearly $1.3B」）。APP 的金額與高年增率超出這些同業例子（AKAM 2025‑Q3；HOOD 2025‑Q3）。

- 2025 年第 3 季調整後 EBITDA：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 報告極高的調整後 EBITDA 與利潤率──「$1.158B，年增 79%，82% 利潤率」，強調高獲利與利潤率擴張。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業報告的絕對 EBITDA 或利潤率通常低得多（HSIC Q3‑2025 $295M；EXPE Q3‑2025 $1.4B 但僅 33% 利潤率）。APP 的 82% 利潤率顯著高於同業範例（HSIC 2025‑Q3；EXPE 2025‑Q3）。

- 2025 年第 3 季 EBITDA 流入率：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 強調極高的季比流入率──「95%，略高於 Q2」，表示增量營收高度轉化為 EBITDA。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業通常談論 EBITDA 水準或利潤率，但較少主張如此高的季度流入率；可比例子聚焦在 EBITDA 絕對值而非近月流入（EXPE 2025‑Q3）。APP 將營運槓桿量化為高流入，與同業較為一般性的報告方式不同（EXPE 2025‑Q3）。

- 2025 年第 3 季自由現金流：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 報告非常大的現金生成且年增強勁：「$1.049B，年增 92%」，將獲利與現金轉換直接掛勾。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業 FCF 範例差異大（FISV Q3‑2025 $1.3B 規模相近；BAX Q3‑2025 $126M 較小）。APP 同時強調高絕對 FCF 與高 YoY 改善（FISV 2025‑Q3；BAX 2025‑Q3）。

- 2025 年第 3 季現金餘額：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 以「$1.7B 現金及約當現金」結束季度，呈現為相對穩健但非超大型的現金位階，相較其利潤/現金流。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業現金餘額範圍廣（PODD Q1‑2025 $1.3B；DXCM Q3‑2025 > $3.3B；SMCI Q3‑2025 $2.54B）。APP 的 $1.7B 屬於這些例子中間值（PODD 2025‑Q1；DXCM 2025‑Q3）。

- 2025 年第 4 季營收指引：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 給出高幅度的單季連比成長目標：「$1.570B–$1.6B，連比成長 12–14%」，預期下一季持續加速。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業指引示例通常數值或幅度不同（PLTR 指引 $1.327B–$1.331B Q4‑2025；DDOG 指引 $912M–$916M Q4）。APP 的指引暗示較同業例子更強的季比加速（PLTR 2025‑Q3；DDOG 2025‑Q3）。

- 2025 年第 4 季調整後 EBITDA 指引：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 目標高額調整後 EBITDA 並維持極高利潤率──「$1.290B–$1.320B，82%–83% 利潤率」，預示利潤率穩定在不尋常的高水準。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業 EBITDA 指引/目標顯示較低利潤率或不同呈現（PAYC 全年指引較低利潤率；AXON 指引約 25% 利潤率）。APP 的 82–83% 遠高於這些同業範例（PAYC 2024‑Q4；AXON 2024‑Q4）。

- 當前每日用戶觸及：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 強調巨量每日觸及「超過 10 億使用者每天」，以規模作為廣告變現的驅動力。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業報告的 MAU/DAU 各不相同（META 在 2025‑Q2 報告「3.4B」每日應用觸及；DASH 報告「數千萬」月活）。APP 的「每日超過 10 億」屬於大型但與同業不同的觸及指標呈現方式（META 2025‑Q2；DASH 2024‑Q2）。

- 平台廣告平均觀看時長 vs 社群：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 主張廣告注意力顯著高於社群平台──「約 35 秒 vs 社群約 7 秒」，用注意力差距為廣告價值背書。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業談及影片觀看時數成長，但少有直接以單次廣告觀看秒數進行平台間比較（META 提到影片時數雙位數成長；TTWO 提供遊戲時數指標）。APP 以每次廣告觀看秒數的明確差距作為差異化主張，比同業的一般性時間趨勢更具體（META 2024‑Q4/2025‑Q3；TTWO 2024‑Q4）。

- 網站/商店庫存的地理可用性：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 明確揭露在歐盟有意限制某些庫存──「可以與 EU 廣告主合作，但不對 EU 地區開放網站或商店廣告庫存... EU 約佔公司業務的低雙位數百分比」，展示受控的區域性推出策略。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業多以地區差異或歐洲市場疲弱論述（HPE「Geographic variation」2024‑Q3；PLTR「Stagnant Europe」2025‑Q3）。APP 的做法比同業更具體，直接說明營運性存量限制（HPE 2024‑Q3；PLTR 2025‑Q3）。

- MAX SSP 在 2025 年第 3 季的成長：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 表示 MAX supply‑side platform「持續以非常健康的速度成長」，將內部平台定義為快速成長的變現引擎。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業平台成長表述從溫和（GDDY「mid‑single digits」）到非常正面（MPWR「very high」需求）。APP 的「非常健康」與這類樂觀語調相符，但 APP 專注在內部廣告變現（GDDY 2025‑Q3；MPWR 2024‑Q3）。

- 法規與監管審查環境：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 反覆指出「在資料、隱私與廣告科技實務上存在高度審查的環境」，將法規風險視為當前營運背景的一部分。
  - 歷史通話證據：多家同業亦警示法規風險（ANET 2024‑Q1「Subject to risks and uncertainties」；HOOD、NVDA 提及持續關注法規發展）。APP 的說法與同業一致，但特別指向 ad‑tech 實務風險而非一般合規風險（ANET 2024‑Q1；HOOD 2023‑Q4；NVDA 2024‑Q2）。

- 進入 S&P 500 後的機構面動態：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 表示「S&P 500 包含帶來的機構動態已經在發酵」，把指數納入視為立即的資本市場順風。
  - 歷史通話證據：同業在不同情境談及機構需求或交易激勵（ALLE 2024‑Q1「Favorable long‑term demand」；COIN 2025‑Q1「Continue investments in trading incentives」）。APP 將指數納入視為當前驅動，而非逐步發酵，強調即時影響（ALLE 2024‑Q1；COIN 2025‑Q1）。

- 資料/隱私/廣告科技的監管背景：
  - APP 的不同點：APP 再次將高度審查置於資料/隱私/廣告科技的背景，並將其與產品可用性與市場策略掛鉤。
  - 歷史通話證據：TTD 等同業描述廣告生態「快速演變且受監管審視」，或稱「對 walled gardens 的持續審查」。APP 的立場與同業一致，但更直接將風險與營運決策連結（TTD 2025‑Q2；TTD 2025‑Q1）。

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

---

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

ORIGINAL EARNINGS CALL TRANSCRIPT:

Operator: Hello and thank you for standing by. My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oracle Corporation Q1 FY2026 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Head of Investor Relations. Ken, please go ahead.
Ken Bond: Thank you, Tiffany. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2026 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our investor relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the investor relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Lawrence Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. A reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads. We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD, and many others. At the end of Q1, remaining performance obligations or RPO now top $455 billion. This is up 359% from last year and up $317 billion from Q4. Our cloud RPO grew nearly 500% on top of 83% growth last year. Now to the results. Using constant currency growth rates, as you can see, we've made some changes to the face of our income statement to better reflect how we manage the business and so you can understand our cloud business dynamics more directly. So here it goes. Total cloud revenue, that's both apps and infrastructure, was up 27% to $7.2 billion. Cloud infrastructure revenue was $3.3 billion, up 54% on top of the 46% growth reported in Q1 last year. OCI consumption revenue was up 57% and demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply. Cloud database services, which were up 32%, now have annualized revenues of nearly $2.8 billion. Autonomous Database revenue was up 43% on top of the 26% growth reported in Q1 last year. Multi-cloud database revenue, where Oracle regions are embedded in AWS, Azure, and GCP, grew 1529% in Q1. Cloud application revenue was $3.8 billion, up 10%, while our strategic back-office application revenue was $2.4 billion, up 16%. Total software revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, down 2%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, up 11% from last year and higher than the 8% growth reported in 17% to $6.2 billion. We have also been on an accelerated journey to adopt AI internally to run more efficiently. I expect our operating income will grow mid-teens this year and higher still in FY2027. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 while GAAP EPS was $1.01. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, which was higher than the 19% guidance and caused EPS to be $0.03 lower. For the last four quarters, operating cash flow was up 13% to $21.5 billion and free cash flow was a negative $5.9 billion with $27.4 billion of CapEx. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $8.1 billion while free cash flow was a negative $362 million with CapEx of $8.5 billion. At quarter end, we had $11 billion in cash and marketable securities and short-term deferred revenue balance was $12 billion, up 5%. Over the last ten years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by a third at an average price of $55, which is, at this point, much less than a quarter of our current stock price. This quarter, we repurchased 440,000 shares for a total of $95 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $5 billion over the last twelve months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. Given our RPO growth, I now expect fiscal year 2026 CapEx will be around $35 billion. As a reminder, the vast majority of our CapEx investments are for revenue-generating equipment that is going into the data centers and not for land or buildings. As we bring more capacity online, we will convert the large RPO backlog into accelerating revenue and profit growth. Now before I dive into specific Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some of the overarching thoughts on fiscal year 2026 and the coming year. Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud infrastructure continues to build. I expect we will sign additional multibillion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed half a trillion dollars. The enormity of this RPO growth enables us to make a large upward revision to the cloud infrastructure portion of our financial plan. We now expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the following four years. Much of this revenue is already booked in our $455 billion RPO number and we are off to a fantastic start this year. Now while much attention is focused on our GPU-related business, our non-GPU infrastructure business continues to grow much faster than our competitors. We are also seeing our industry-specific cloud applications drive customers to our back-office cloud app. And finally, the Oracle database is booming with 34 multi-cloud data centers now live inside of Azure, GCP, and AWS, and we will deliver another 37 data centers for a total of 71. All these trends point to revenue growth going higher. For fiscal year 2026, we remain confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth of 16% in constant currency. Beyond fiscal year 2026, I'm even more confident in our ability to further accelerate our top and bottom line growth rate. As mentioned, we will provide an update on our long-range financial targets at our financial analyst meeting at Oracle AI World in Las Vegas in October. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a $0.03 positive impact on EPS and a 1% positive effect on revenue depending on rounding. However, the actual currency impact may be different as it was in Q1. Here it goes. Total revenue is expected to grow from 12% to 14% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 14% to percent in US dollars at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 32% to 36% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 33% to 37% in US dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 10% and be between $1.58 and $1.62 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 10% to 12% and be between $1.61 and $1.65 in USD. And lastly, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base tax rate of 19%, however, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary as they did this quarter. Larry, over to you.
Lawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Eventually, AI will change everything. But right now, AI is fundamentally transforming Oracle and the rest of the computer industry. Though not everyone fully grasped the magnitude of the tsunami that is approaching. Look at our quarterly numbers. Some things are undeniably evident. Several world-class AI companies have chosen Oracle to build large-scale GPU-centric data centers to train their AI models. That's because Oracle builds gigawatt-scale data centers that are faster and more cost-efficient at training AI models than anyone else in the world. Training AI models is a gigantic multi-billion dollar market. It's hard to conceive of a technology market as large as that one. But if you look close, you can find one that's even larger. It's the market for AI inferencing. Millions of customers using those AI models to run businesses and governments. In fact, the AI inferencing market will be much, much larger than the AI training market. AI inferencing will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug design, interpreting medical diagnostic images and laboratory results, automating laboratories, placing bets in financial markets, automating legal processes, automating financial processes, automating sales processes. AI is going to write, that is, generate, the computer programs called AI agents that will automate your sales and marketing processes. Let me repeat that. AI is going to automatically write the computer programs that will then automate your sales processes and your legal processes and everything else and your factories and so on. Think about it. AI inferencing. It's AI inferencing that will change everything. Oracle is aggressively pursuing the AI market. And we're not doing badly in the AI training market, by the way. The difference seems bigger. Oracle is aggressively pursuing the inferencing market as well as the AI training market. We think we are in a pretty good position to be a winner in the inferencing market because Oracle is by far the world's largest custodian of high-value private enterprise data. With the introduction of our new AI database, we added a very important new way for you to store your data in our database. You can vectorize it. And by vectorizing it, by vectorizing all your data, all your data can be understood by AI models. Then we made it very easy for our customers to directly connect all their databases, all their new Oracle AI databases, and cloud storage OCI cloud storage, to the world's most advanced AI reasoning models. ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Lama, all of which are uniquely available in the Oracle Cloud. After you vectorize your data and link it to an LLM, the LLM of your choice, you can then ask any question you can think of. For example, how will the latest tariffs impact next quarter's revenue and profit? You ask that question. The large language model will then apply advanced reasoning to the combination of your private enterprise data plus publicly available data. You get answers to important questions without ever compromising the safety and security of your private data. Again, I'd like you to think about this for a moment. A lot of companies are saying we're big into AI because we're writing agents. Well, guess what? We're writing a bunch of agents too. But when they introduced ChatGPT almost three years ago, what you've got to do is have a conversation and ask questions. You weren't automating some process with an agent. You could ask whatever question you wanted to ask and get a well-reasoned answer with all of the latest and best information and high-quality reasoning to go along with it. Who's offering that to customers? We'll be the first. When we deliberate and demonstrate it at AI World next month. That's what our customers have been asking for ever since the introduction of ChatGPT 3.5, almost three years ago. I wanted to ask questions about anything. And, therefore, you need to understand my enterprise data as well as all the publicly available data. Then you can answer the questions that are most important to me. Well, now they can ask those questions. Back to you, Safra.
Safra Catz: Thank you, Larry. Tiffany, please poll the audience for questions.
Operator: At this time, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, simply press star 1 again. Your first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
John DiFucci: Thank you for taking my question. Listen. Even I am sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward. And this question, I guess, is sort of purposely open-ended. So Lawrence Ellison and Safra Catz, Oracle's become the de facto standard for AI training workloads, and you make money from it. And you have a lot of faith in that. But, clearly, there's more here than just AI training. I know it's a big part of it. You talked about it. But can you talk about what else, a little more detail about what else is driving these pretty amazing forecasts?
Safra Catz: Go ahead, Larry. I mean, that you were discovering this.
Lawrence Ellison: Yeah. Well, a lot of people are looking for inferencing capacity. I mean, people are running out of inferencing capacity. I mean, the company that called us, I mentioned it, I think, either last quarter or the quarter before, someone called us, we'll take all the capacity you have that's currently not being used anywhere in the world. We don't care. And I've never gotten a call like that. That's a very unusual call. That was for inferencing, not training. There's a huge amount of demand for inferencing. And if you think about it, in the end, all this money we're spending on training is going to have to be translated into products that are sold, which is all inferencing. And the inferencing market, again, is much larger than the training market. And, yes, we are building like everybody else, we're building agents with our application. But we're doing much more than that. You know, I no one's shown me a ChatGPT 3.5. Again, the three years ago, a little less than three years ago when ChatGPT amazed the world. And you could simply talk to your computer and ask questions and get well-reasoned answers based on the latest and most precise information. As long as you ask those questions about publicly available data. And there's a lot of publicly available data. But if you combine the publicly available data with the enterprise data, which companies really don't want to share, you have to do it in such a way that your private enterprise data stays private yet the large language model can still use it for reasoning so as to answer your question, like, how do the latest tariffs or the latest steel prices or whatever affect my quarterly results? Affect my ability to deliver products, affect my revenue, affect my cost. You know, answer those kinds of questions. To answer those kinds of questions, we have to and we have. We had to change our database, fundamentally change our database so you can vectorize all data. That's the form in which large language models understand information is that after it's been vectorized. And then allowing people to ask any question they want about anything. And that's exactly what we've done. But unless you have a database that is secure and reliable and linked to all of the popular LLMs. And we've done all of that. Unless you have that, and you have you have to tell me who else has that besides Oracle. Unless you have that, this can be very hard for you to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience on top of your data as well as publicly available data. That's a unique value proposition for Oracle. And that's because, again, we're the custodian of all of much more data than any of the application companies. They have their application data. They measure their customers in tens of thousands. We measure our customers in millions of databases. So we think we're better positioned than anybody to take advantage of inferencing. In addition, by the way, aside from just our GPU and all of that, we have become the de facto cloud for many of our customers. Again, they want to put some things in our public cloud or in our competitor public cloud working with the Oracle database. Simultaneously, there are a lot of reasons why they want what's called either a dedicated region or cloud at customer. We give our customers so much choice that they're very unusual for us not to be able to meet a customer's needs in one way or another. And then, of course, we have every piece of the stack. We have the infrastructure, we have the database that you're going to hear a lot about. As really the only reasonable store for data that you want to use AI models again, and then we have all of these applications that are just taking off. So we've we just have a lot of different layers. They're all moving in the same direction, and they all benefit our customers when used together.
John DiFucci: Listen. My dad, let me just go ahead. Go ahead, John. I've got don't mean to cut you're gonna compliment us and interrupted you. What a what a I'm so I apologize for being rude. Listen. I was just gonna say my hat's off to both of you. I have been doing this a really long time, and I tell my old team, pay attention to this. Even those that are not working on Oracle. Because this is a career event happening right now, and it looks it's just amazing. And I guess I'm just really happy for you and congrats on this. Amazing.
Lawrence Ellison: Thanks.
John DiFucci: A lot of work. Keep doing it. Keep doing it.
Lawrence Ellison: It's been a lot of work. And well, let me mention two other things. I think that are actually shocking. We have gotten the entire Oracle cloud, the whole thing, every feature, every function of the Oracle cloud, down to something we can put into a handful of racks, three racks. We call it butterfly. It costs $6 million. So we can give you the we can give you a private version of the Oracle Cloud with every feature, every security feature, every function, everything we do. For $6 million. I think the cost for the other hyperscalers is more than five more than a 100 times that. So we can actually give our customers cloud at customer, the full cloud at customer, and we have companies like Vodafone in I I'm not sure which companies I can name or which companies I can't. We have large companies that are buying basically their own Oracle Cloud region. In fact, multiple Oracle Cloud regions. Because they don't want to have any neighbors in their cloud. They don't want other companies in their cloud. But they want the full cloud. They want to pay as they consume. They want all the features, all the function, all the safety, the security. They don't want to have to buy it. They don't want to have to buy and own the software and the hardware. They want us to maintain it, build the network, supply all of that, and they just want to pay for consumption. We can do that at an entry-level price that's 1% of what our competitors can offer. That's one thing. Another thing. Let me give you one more, and I'll stop there. We also have the most advanced application generator of any company. It's interesting. We're an application company and a cloud infrastructure company. And, therefore, we build applications. And as we build applications, we'd like to be more efficient. And the way to be more efficient is to build AI application generators. And we have been doing that. And the latest applications that we are building we're not building them. They're being generated by AI. And we think we're far, far ahead of any of the other application companies in terms of generating the applications. So that's another very significant advantage we have. And, of course, and it's funny. You know, I made the comment that we don't charge separately for our AI and our applications because our applications are AI. They're entirely AI. The new ones, the new ones that we're building, they're nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow. That's all they are. How do you charge separately for that? That's it. That's every application that we have. But the applications are better, and, hopefully, we'll sell more, and that's the way we'll get paid for them. I got thank you, John, for the very nice compliment. Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Safra.
Safra Catz: Thank you, John, for all these years following us. So kindly also. Thanks. Great day. Probably time for another question. At this point. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brad Zelnick: Great. Thanks very much. And I think we're all kind of in shock in a very, very good way. Larry, there's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing than these results that you just put up. And Oracle has in your fifty-year track record of navigating transitions and coming out on top. But as we think about enterprise applications, investors are fairly pessimistic these days, and I'd love to hear your perspective. Where do you see this all going for the industry? Where does the market share go for the companies that don't have the database, that don't have the advantages that you have all the way down to the silicon? Is this maybe an extinction event, you know, curious to hear what you think.
Lawrence Ellison: Well, I think we have substantial advantage because we are an infrastructure company, and we are an application company. There are two things that happen. As an application company, we knew we had to start generating our applications. We just couldn't do it with armies of people anymore. We still need people. Don't get me wrong. But the number of people we need is substantially less. And we can build slash generate much better applications than we can hand build. And we've been working on these AI application generators for some time, and then we're actually using them. But the thing is we're not just building application generators. We're building application generators, and then we're building the applications. Which gives us insights to make the application generator better. It's a huge advantage to be on both sides of that equation. Both being an application builder and a builder of the technology of the application generation technology. The AI, the underlying AI application code generators. That's a huge advantage. Let me give you another advantage, which is often a disadvantage. We're very large. We no longer sell individual discrete applications. We sell suites of applications. We decided to go into the medical business against Epic believing that we could solve much more of the problem. Because we're much bigger than they are. And we're by the way, we're much bigger than Workday. And, or ServiceNow. And we're solving a larger portion of the problem. We're able to do all of ERP then we can add all of CRM. But all the pieces are engineered to fit together. That makes it so much easier for customers to consume. So we think that selling being good at application generation, the underlying technology, makes us better build better applications, enables us to build more applications so we can solve more of the problem. So the customers don't have to do all that system integration across multiple vendors. We can just build a suite where all the pieces are engineered to fit together. I think we have tremendous advantages in the application space. We have tremendous advantages in the AI inferencing space where we can again, what we'll demonstrate at Oracle AI World next month is we've taken all of our customer data, all of it. I want to go into all the details now. But you can ask any question you want to ask. Who's your salesperson? Who's the number one prospect in my territory? What product should I be selling them next? What are the best references for me to use to persuade them to use our product? You can get all of those questions answered for you immediately if you're a salesperson. The engineers can look at which features of Oracle Financials are people making the most errors when they're using those features. What do I have to fix and make easier to use? You just ask the question. Because all of that data is available to AI models. Is there anyone else doing this? Not that I know of. It's a huge advantage for us.
Brad Zelnick: We look forward to AI World, Larry. Thank you. It's an amazing day for Oracle. It's a remarkable day for the industry. Thanks again, and congrats.
Lawrence Ellison: Thank you. Thank you so much.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Derrick Wood: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll echo my congratulations on this momentous quarter. Safra, the fact that you delivered over $300 billion of new RPO in Q1, just really amazing to see it's going to require a lot of infrastructure build-out. So could you provide a bit more context on how much CapEx and operational cost structure will be needed to fully service these contracts, how we should think about the ramp of these costs relative to the ramp in revenue over the next few years, and generally, how investors should be thinking about the ROI on the spend?
Safra Catz: Sure. So first of all, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and as I've said very clearly beforehand, we do not own the property. We do not own the buildings. What we do own and what we engineer is the equipment, and that's equipment that is optimized for the Oracle Cloud. It has extremely special networking capabilities. It has technical capabilities from Larry and his team that allows us to run these workloads much, much faster. And as a result, it's much cheaper than our competitors. And depending on the workload. Now because of that, what we do is we put in that equipment only when it's time, and, usually, very quickly assuming that our customer accepts it, we're already generating revenue. Right away. The faster they accept the system and that it meets their needs, the faster they start using it. The sooner we have revenue. This is, in some ways, I don't want to call it asset light, from the finance world, but it's assets pretty light. And that is really an advantage for us. I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings. That's not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage, the just the whole way we put these systems together. And by the way, they are identical, and very simplified and, again, making it possible for us to be very profitable while still being able to offer our customers an incredibly compelling price. What I have indicated is that CapEx looks like it's going to be about $35 billion for this fiscal year. But because we're monitoring this, we're literally putting it in right when we take possession, and then handing it over to generate revenue right away. So we have a very good line of sight for our capabilities to put this out and to just spend on that CapEx right before it starts generating revenue. But at this point, I'm looking at $35 billion for the year. And I think, I mean, it could be a little higher, but I think and if it is higher, it's good news. Because it means more capacity has been handed to me in terms of floor space. And as you also know, we are embedded in our competitors' clouds, again, all we are responsible for to pay for is in fact our equipment, and that goes right away. And there, we're moving ultimately to 71 data centers embedded in our competitors or flash partners.
Derrick Wood: Very encouraging to hear.
Lawrence Ellison: Can I let me add a couple of very short things? One is we just turned over a giant data hall to one of our customers. And the acceptance time could have been as long as a couple of months. It was one week. It was one week from the time we, quote, owned officially owned the equipment. And they were testing it to the time they started paying for it. One week. So we have an extraordinary team that's doing an extraordinary job of making sure that we get the equipment working very quickly. And our customer is going to accept it. They want to accept it as fast as possible. Because they want to do the work. They want to train their models. And this one took a huge hall, took one week for acceptance. It was an extraordinary event. The other we are a very large consumer of networking equipment, GPUs, etcetera. Because we are a very large consumer, we are able, I think, to get better financing terms from the vendors than some of their people. So I think we have that going for us as well. I think we're going to do very, very well on the finance side. We have advantages there as well.
Derrick Wood: Great. Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Safra.
Operator: Of course. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you very much, Larry and Safra, and, frankly, team Oracle. Amazing and congratulations. I'd like to focus on the AI training business you've been winning. Could you please explain to us how Oracle can create enough of a differentiated moat to assure this business does not get commoditized and how do you continue to drive strong earnings and free cash flow from the training business even if training slows. I think people really need to understand that.
Lawrence Ellison: Well, I got let me I mean, I could do it in with one sentence. Our networks move data very, very fast. And if we can move data faster than the other people, if we have advantages in our super our GPU super clusters that are performance advantages, if you're paying by the hour, if we're twice as fast, we're half the cost.
Safra Catz: Yeah. Well, that's tight. Hard to beat that. Impressive.
Mark Moerdler: I agree.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. I really appreciate you squeezing me in. I originally was going to ask you if the new Oracle AI database really opens up the general enterprise inferencing market, and based off your script, it sounds like the answer to that question is hell yes. So I guess my follow-up question would be, how do you see that pacing happening over the course of the next few years? How soon after the introduction of the Oracle AI database would you expect your enterprise customers, your sophisticated customers to really be open to interrogating their enterprise data in this fashion? And how does the current supply constraint environment stand in the way of that demand or is it solving as we speak?
Safra Catz: I don't know if, Larry, you want to cover it. You covered it in No. We've got it.
Lawrence Ellison: Good. Marks. Go ahead. You got it. Go ahead. Okay. I think who wouldn't want that? I mean, I think everyone says they want to use AI. I mean, every I mean, CEOs, they don't want to use AI. Heads of state, heads of government say they want to use AI. We've never had consumers like that. I mean, we nor historically, we don't deal with CEOs. Now we deal with CEOs. Now we deal with heads of government and heads of state. On this because AI is so important. And letting people have you know, use AI on top of their data. That is what they want to do. But they didn't know how to do it securely. They didn't know how to well, they didn't know how to do it, period. And then one of the big risks was, oh my god. I can't share my JPMorgan Chase can't share all of its data. Goldman Sachs can't share all of its data with OpenAI. They won't do it. So or XAI or LAMA or, you know, Meta. They won't it's got to keep it private. So we've got to keep your private data private. We've got to keep your private data secure. But we have to make it available for inferencing by the latest and best reasoning models from OpenAI and XAI and everyone else. And because we have the database, because we can vectorize all the data in the database, because we have very elaborate security models in our database, in the Oracle database, we can do all that. We can deliver all that. And then what we chose to do was to with the AI database was not only make sure we can vectorize all the data so it can be understood by the AI model, we then bundled it with all of the AI models. That's why we did a deal with Google. That's why we did all of these deals where, you know, Gemini you can get Gemini from the Oracle Cloud. You can get from the Oracle Cloud. You can get from the Oracle Cloud. You get Walmart from the Oracle Cloud. I could go on. So we bundled them together. So it's very easy for our customers to use these large language models on a combination. And that's what they want is a combination of all of the publicly available data and all of their enterprise data. Which allows them to ask and get answered any question they can think of, any question that's important to them. Everyone wants it. I think the demand is going to be insatiable. But we can deliver a lot of databases and a lot of AI across our cloud over the next several years. We're in a good position to do that.
Safra Catz: And this is going to be one of the reasons that Oracle databases, which are still the bulk of the enterprise market by a lot, are going to finally move into the cloud. Many of them will move in the public cloud using the Oracle AI database, but many and the largest enterprises will want their own either dedicated regions or Oracle Cloud at customer. And, again, they can finally get the benefit of AI for their own data using any LLM that they want because they're all in our cloud too.
Alex Zukin: It sounds like very high margin AI revenue, guys. Congratulations.
Safra Catz: Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads. We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who's who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD, and many others. At the end of Q1, remaining performance obligations or RPO now top $455 billion. This is up 359% from last year and up $317 billion from Q4. Our cloud RPO grew nearly 500% on top of 83% growth last year. Now to the results. Using constant currency growth rates, as you can see, we've made some changes to the face of our income statement to better reflect how we manage the business and so you can understand our cloud business dynamics more directly. So here it goes. Total cloud revenue, that's both apps and infrastructure, was up 27% to $7.2 billion. Cloud infrastructure revenue was $3.3 billion, up 54% on top of the 46% growth reported in Q1 last year. OCI consumption revenue was up 57% and demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply. Cloud database services, which were up 32%, now have annualized revenues of nearly $2.8 billion. Autonomous Database revenue was up 43% on top of the 26% growth reported in Q1 last year. Multi-cloud database revenue, where Oracle regions are embedded in AWS, Azure, and GCP, grew 1529% in Q1. Cloud application revenue was $3.8 billion, up 10%, while our strategic back-office application revenue was $2.4 billion, up 16%. Total software revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, down 2%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, up 11% from last year and higher than the 8% growth reported in 17% to $6.2 billion. We have also been on an accelerated journey to adopt AI internally to run more efficiently. I expect our operating income will grow mid-teens this year and higher still in FY2027. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 while GAAP EPS was $1.01. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, which was higher than the 19% guidance and caused EPS to be $0.03 lower. For the last four quarters, operating cash flow was up 13% to $21.5 billion and free cash flow was a negative $5.9 billion with $27.4 billion of CapEx. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $8.1 billion while free cash flow was a negative $362 million with CapEx of $8.5 billion. At quarter end, we had $11 billion in cash and marketable securities and short-term deferred revenue balance was $12 billion, up 5%. Over the last ten years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by a third at an average price of $55, which is, at this point, much less than a quarter of our current stock price. This quarter, we repurchased 440,000 shares for a total of $95 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $5 billion over the last twelve months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. Given our RPO growth, I now expect fiscal year 2026 CapEx will be around $35 billion. As a reminder, the vast majority of our CapEx investments are for revenue-generating equipment that is going into the data centers and not for land or buildings. As we bring more capacity online, we will convert the large RPO backlog into accelerating revenue and profit growth. Now before I dive into specific Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some of the overarching thoughts on fiscal year 2026 and the coming year. Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud infrastructure continues to build. I expect we will sign additional multibillion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed half a trillion dollars. The enormity of this RPO growth enables us to make a large upward revision to the cloud infrastructure portion of our financial plan. We now expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the following four years. Much of this revenue is already booked in our $455 billion RPO number and we are off to a fantastic start this year. Now while much attention is focused on our GPU-related business, our non-GPU infrastructure business continues to grow much faster than our competitors. We are also seeing our industry-specific cloud applications drive customers to our back-office cloud app. And finally, the Oracle database is booming with 34 multi-cloud data centers now live inside of Azure, GCP, and AWS, and we will deliver another 37 data centers for a total of 71. All these trends point to revenue growth going higher. For fiscal year 2026, we remain confident and committed to full-year total revenue growth of 16% in constant currency. Beyond fiscal year 2026, I'm even more confident in our ability to further accelerate our top and bottom line growth rate. As mentioned, we will provide an update on our long-range financial targets at our financial analyst meeting at Oracle AI World in Las Vegas in October. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a $0.03 positive impact on EPS and a 1% positive effect on revenue depending on rounding. However, the actual currency impact may be different as it was in Q1. Here it goes. Total revenue is expected to grow from 12% to 14% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 14% to percent in US dollars at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 32% to 36% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 33% to 37% in US dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 10% and be between $1.58 and $1.62 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 10% to 12% and be between $1.61 and $1.65 in USD. And lastly, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base tax rate of 19%, however, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary as they did this quarter. Larry, over to you.
Lawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Eventually, AI will change everything. But right now, AI is fundamentally transforming Oracle and the rest of the computer industry. Though not everyone fully grasped the magnitude of the tsunami that is approaching. Look at our quarterly numbers. Some things are undeniably evident. Several world-class AI companies have chosen Oracle to build large-scale GPU-centric data centers to train their AI models. That's because Oracle builds gigawatt-scale data centers that are faster and more cost-efficient at training AI models than anyone else in the world. Training AI models is a gigantic multi-billion dollar market. It's hard to conceive of a technology market as large as that one. But if you look close, you can find one that's even larger. It's the market for AI inferencing. Millions of customers using those AI models to run businesses and governments. In fact, the AI inferencing market will be much, much larger than the AI training market. AI inferencing will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug design, interpreting medical diagnostic images and laboratory results, automating laboratories, placing bets in financial markets, automating legal processes, automating financial processes, automating sales processes. AI is going to write, that is, generate, the computer programs called AI agents that will automate your sales and marketing processes. Let me repeat that. AI is going to automatically write the computer programs that will then automate your sales processes and your legal processes and everything else and your factories and so on. Think about it. AI inferencing. It's AI inferencing that will change everything. Oracle is aggressively pursuing the AI market. And we're not doing badly in the AI training market, by the way. The difference seems bigger. Oracle is aggressively pursuing the inferencing market as well as the AI training market. We think we are in a pretty good position to be a winner in the inferencing market because Oracle is by far the world's largest custodian of high-value private enterprise data. With the introduction of our new AI database, we added a very important new way for you to store your data in our database. You can vectorize it. And by vectorizing it, by vectorizing all your data, all your data can be understood by AI models. Then we made it very easy for our customers to directly connect all their databases, all their new Oracle AI databases, and cloud storage OCI cloud storage, to the world's most advanced AI reasoning models. ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Lama, all of which are uniquely available in the Oracle Cloud. After you vectorize your data and link it to an LLM, the LLM of your choice, you can then ask any question you can think of. For example, how will the latest tariffs impact next quarter's revenue and profit? You ask that question. The large language model will then apply advanced reasoning to the combination of your private enterprise data plus publicly available data. You get answers to important questions without ever compromising the safety and security of your private data. Again, I'd like you to think about this for a moment. A lot of companies are saying we're big into AI because we're writing agents. Well, guess what? We're writing a bunch of agents too. But when they introduced ChatGPT almost three years ago, what you've got to do is have a conversation and ask questions. You weren't automating some process with an agent. You could ask whatever question you wanted to ask and get a well-reasoned answer with all of the latest and best information and high-quality reasoning to go along with it. Who's offering that to customers? We'll be the first. When we deliberate and demonstrate it at AI World next month. That's what our customers have been asking for ever since the introduction of ChatGPT 3.5, almost three years ago. I wanted to ask questions about anything. And, therefore, you need to understand my enterprise data as well as all the publicly available data. Then you can answer the questions that are most important to me. Well, now they can ask those questions. Back to you, Safra.
Safra Catz: Thank you, Larry. Tiffany, please poll the audience for questions.
Operator: At this time, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, simply press star 1 again. Your first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
John DiFucci: Thank you for taking my question. Listen. Even I am sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward. And this question, I guess, is sort of purposely open-ended. So Lawrence Ellison and Safra Catz, Oracle's become the de facto standard for AI training workloads, and you make money from it. And you have a lot of faith in that. But, clearly, there's more here than just AI training. I know it's a big part of it. You talked about it. But can you talk about what else, a little more detail about what else is driving these pretty amazing forecasts?
Safra Catz: Go ahead, Larry. I mean, that you were discovering this.
Lawrence Ellison: Yeah. Well, a lot of people are looking for inferencing capacity. I mean, people are running out of inferencing capacity. I mean, the company that called us, I mentioned it, I think, either last quarter or the quarter before, someone called us, we'll take all the capacity you have that's currently not being used anywhere in the world. We don't care. And I've never gotten a call like that. That's a very unusual call. That was for inferencing, not training. There's a huge amount of demand for inferencing. And if you think about it, in the end, all this money we're spending on training is going to have to be translated into products that are sold, which is all inferencing. And the inferencing market, again, is much larger than the training market. And, yes, we are building like everybody else, we're building agents with our application. But we're doing much more than that. You know, I no one's shown me a ChatGPT 3.5. Again, the three years ago, a little less than three years ago when ChatGPT amazed the world. And you could simply talk to your computer and ask questions and get well-reasoned answers based on the latest and most precise information. As long as you ask those questions about publicly available data. And there's a lot of publicly available data. But if you combine the publicly available data with the enterprise data, which companies really don't want to share, you have to do it in such a way that your private enterprise data stays private yet the large language model can still use it for reasoning so as to answer your question, like, how do the latest tariffs or the latest steel prices or whatever affect my quarterly results? Affect my ability to deliver products, affect my revenue, affect my cost. You know, answer those kinds of questions. To answer those kinds of questions, we have to and we have. We had to change our database, fundamentally change our database so you can vectorize all data. That's the form in which large language models understand information is that after it's been vectorized. And then allowing people to ask any question they want about anything. And that's exactly what we've done. But unless you have a database that is secure and reliable and linked to all of the popular LLMs. And we've done all of that. Unless you have that, and you have you have to tell me who else has that besides Oracle. Unless you have that, this can be very hard for you to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience on top of your data as well as publicly available data. That's a unique value proposition for Oracle. And that's because, again, we're the custodian of all of much more data than any of the application companies. They have their application data. They measure their customers in tens of thousands. We measure our customers in millions of databases. So we think we're better positioned than anybody to take advantage of inferencing. In addition, by the way, aside from just our GPU and all of that, we have become the de facto cloud for many of our customers. Again, they want to put some things in our public cloud or in our competitor public cloud working with the Oracle database. Simultaneously, there are a lot of reasons why they want what's called either a dedicated region or cloud at customer. We give our customers so much choice that they're very unusual for us not to be able to meet a customer's needs in one way or another. And then, of course, we have every piece of the stack. We have the infrastructure, we have the database that you're going to hear a lot about. As really the only reasonable store for data that you want to use AI models again, and then we have all of these applications that are just taking off. So we've we just have a lot of different layers. They're all moving in the same direction, and they all benefit our customers when used together.
John DiFucci: Listen. My dad, let me just go ahead. Go ahead, John. I've got don't mean to cut you're gonna compliment us and interrupted you. What a what a I'm so I apologize for being rude. Listen. I was just gonna say my hat's off to both of you. I have been doing this a really long time, and I tell my old team, pay attention to this. Even those that are not working on Oracle. Because this is a career event happening right now, and it looks it's just amazing. And I guess I'm just really happy for you and congrats on this. Amazing.
Lawrence Ellison: Thanks.
John DiFucci: A lot of work. Keep doing it. Keep doing it.
Lawrence Ellison: It's been a lot of work. And well, let me mention two other things. I think that are actually shocking. We have gotten the entire Oracle cloud, the whole thing, every feature, every function of the Oracle cloud, down to something we can put into a handful of racks, three racks. We call it butterfly. It costs $6 million. So we can give you the we can give you a private version of the Oracle Cloud with every feature, every security feature, every function, everything we do. For $6 million. I think the cost for the other hyperscalers is more than five more than a 100 times that. So we can actually give our customers cloud at customer, the full cloud at customer, and we have companies like Vodafone in I I'm not sure which companies I can name or which companies I can't. We have large companies that are buying basically their own Oracle Cloud region. In fact, multiple Oracle Cloud regions. Because they don't want to have any neighbors in their cloud. They don't want other companies in their cloud. But they want the full cloud. They want to pay as they consume. They want all the features, all the function, all the safety, the security. They don't want to have to buy it. They don't want to have to buy and own the software and the hardware. They want us to maintain it, build the network, supply all of that, and they just want to pay for consumption. We can do that at an entry-level price that's 1% of what our competitors can offer. That's one thing. Another thing. Let me give you one more, and I'll stop there. We also have the most advanced application generator of any company. It's interesting. We're an application company and a cloud infrastructure company. And, therefore, we build applications. And as we build applications, we'd like to be more efficient. And the way to be more efficient is to build AI application generators. And we have been doing that. And the latest applications that we are building we're not building them. They're being generated by AI. And we think we're far, far ahead of any of the other application companies in terms of generating the applications. So that's another very significant advantage we have. And, of course, and it's funny. You know, I made the comment that we don't charge separately for our AI and our applications because our applications are AI. They're entirely AI. The new ones, the new ones that we're building, they're nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow. That's all they are. How do you charge separately for that? That's it. That's every application that we have. But the applications are better, and, hopefully, we'll sell more, and that's the way we'll get paid for them. I got thank you, John, for the very nice compliment. Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Safra.
Safra Catz: Thank you, John, for all these years following us. So kindly also. Thanks. Great day. Probably time for another question. At this point. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Brad Zelnick: Great. Thanks very much. And I think we're all kind of in shock in a very, very good way. Larry, there's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing than these results that you just put up. And Oracle has in your fifty-year track record of navigating transitions and coming out on top. But as we think about enterprise applications, investors are fairly pessimistic these days, and I'd love to hear your perspective. Where do you see this all going for the industry? Where does the market share go for the companies that don't have the database, that don't have the advantages that you have all the way down to the silicon? Is this maybe an extinction event, you know, curious to hear what you think.
Lawrence Ellison: Well, I think we have substantial advantage because we are an infrastructure company, and we are an application company. There are two things that happen. As an application company, we knew we had to start generating our applications. We just couldn't do it with armies of people anymore. We still need people. Don't get me wrong. But the number of people we need is substantially less. And we can build slash generate much better applications than we can hand build. And we've been working on these AI application generators for some time, and then we're actually using them. But the thing is we're not just building application generators. We're building application generators, and then we're building the applications. Which gives us insights to make the application generator better. It's a huge advantage to be on both sides of that equation. Both being an application builder and a builder of the technology of the application generation technology. The AI, the underlying AI application code generators. That's a huge advantage. Let me give you another advantage, which is often a disadvantage. We're very large. We no longer sell individual discrete applications. We sell suites of applications. We decided to go into the medical business against Epic believing that we could solve much more of the problem. Because we're much bigger than they are. And we're by the way, we're much bigger than Workday. And, or ServiceNow. And we're solving a larger portion of the problem. We're able to do all of ERP then we can add all of CRM. But all the pieces are engineered to fit together. That makes it so much easier for customers to consume. So we think that selling being good at application generation, the underlying technology, makes us better build better applications, enables us to build more applications so we can solve more of the problem. So the customers don't have to do all that system integration across multiple vendors. We can just build a suite where all the pieces are engineered to fit together. I think we have tremendous advantages in the application space. We have tremendous advantages in the AI inferencing space where we can again, what we'll demonstrate at Oracle AI World next month is we've taken all of our customer data, all of it. I want to go into all the details now. But you can ask any question you want to ask. Who's your salesperson? Who's the number one prospect in my territory? What product should I be selling them next? What are the best references for me to use to persuade them to use our product? You can get all of those questions answered for you immediately if you're a salesperson. The engineers can look at which features of Oracle Financials are people making the most errors when they're using those features. What do I have to fix and make easier to use? You just ask the question. Because all of that data is available to AI models. Is there anyone else doing this? Not that I know of. It's a huge advantage for us.
Brad Zelnick: We look forward to AI World, Larry. Thank you. It's an amazing day for Oracle. It's a remarkable day for the industry. Thanks again, and congrats.
Lawrence Ellison: Thank you. Thank you so much.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Derrick Wood: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll echo my congratulations on this momentous quarter. Safra, the fact that you delivered over $300 billion of new RPO in Q1, just really amazing to see it's going to require a lot of infrastructure build-out. So could you provide a bit more context on how much CapEx and operational cost structure will be needed to fully service these contracts, how we should think about the ramp of these costs relative to the ramp in revenue over the next few years, and generally, how investors should be thinking about the ROI on the spend?
Safra Catz: Sure. So first of all, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and as I've said very clearly beforehand, we do not own the property. We do not own the buildings. What we do own and what we engineer is the equipment, and that's equipment that is optimized for the Oracle Cloud. It has extremely special networking capabilities. It has technical capabilities from Larry and his team that allows us to run these workloads much, much faster. And as a result, it's much cheaper than our competitors. And depending on the workload. Now because of that, what we do is we put in that equipment only when it's time, and, usually, very quickly assuming that our customer accepts it, we're already generating revenue. Right away. The faster they accept the system and that it meets their needs, the faster they start using it. The sooner we have revenue. This is, in some ways, I don't want to call it asset light, from the finance world, but it's assets pretty light. And that is really an advantage for us. I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings. That's not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage, the just the whole way we put these systems together. And by the way, they are identical, and very simplified and, again, making it possible for us to be very profitable while still being able to offer our customers an incredibly compelling price. What I have indicated is that CapEx looks like it's going to be about $35 billion for this fiscal year. But because we're monitoring this, we're literally putting it in right when we take possession, and then handing it over to generate revenue right away. So we have a very good line of sight for our capabilities to put this out and to just spend on that CapEx right before it starts generating revenue. But at this point, I'm looking at $35 billion for the year. And I think, I mean, it could be a little higher, but I think and if it is higher, it's good news. Because it means more capacity has been handed to me in terms of floor space. And as you also know, we are embedded in our competitors' clouds, again, all we are responsible for to pay for is in fact our equipment, and that goes right away. And there, we're moving ultimately to 71 data centers embedded in our competitors or flash partners.
Derrick Wood: Very encouraging to hear.
Lawrence Ellison: Can I let me add a couple of very short things? One is we just turned over a giant data hall to one of our customers. And the acceptance time could have been as long as a couple of months. It was one week. It was one week from the time we, quote, owned officially owned the equipment. And they were testing it to the time they started paying for it. One week. So we have an extraordinary team that's doing an extraordinary job of making sure that we get the equipment working very quickly. And our customer is going to accept it. They want to accept it as fast as possible. Because they want to do the work. They want to train their models. And this one took a huge hall, took one week for acceptance. It was an extraordinary event. The other we are a very large consumer of networking equipment, GPUs, etcetera. Because we are a very large consumer, we are able, I think, to get better financing terms from the vendors than some of their people. So I think we have that going for us as well. I think we're going to do very, very well on the finance side. We have advantages there as well.
Derrick Wood: Great. Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Safra.
Operator: Of course. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you very much, Larry and Safra, and, frankly, team Oracle. Amazing and congratulations. I'd like to focus on the AI training business you've been winning. Could you please explain to us how Oracle can create enough of a differentiated moat to assure this business does not get commoditized and how do you continue to drive strong earnings and free cash flow from the training business even if training slows. I think people really need to understand that.
Lawrence Ellison: Well, I got let me I mean, I could do it in with one sentence. Our networks move data very, very fast. And if we can move data faster than the other people, if we have advantages in our super our GPU super clusters that are performance advantages, if you're paying by the hour, if we're twice as fast, we're half the cost.
Safra Catz: Yeah. Well, that's tight. Hard to beat that. Impressive.
Mark Moerdler: I agree.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. I really appreciate you squeezing me in. I originally was going to ask you if the new Oracle AI database really opens up the general enterprise inferencing market, and based off your script, it sounds like the answer to that question is hell yes. So I guess my follow-up question would be, how do you see that pacing happening over the course of the next few years? How soon after the introduction of the Oracle AI database would you expect your enterprise customers, your sophisticated customers to really be open to interrogating their enterprise data in this fashion? And how does the current supply constraint environment stand in the way of that demand or is it solving as we speak?
Safra Catz: I don't know if, Larry, you want to cover it. You covered it in No. We've got it.
Lawrence Ellison: Good. Marks. Go ahead. You got it. Go ahead. Okay. I think who wouldn't want that? I mean, I think everyone says they want to use AI. I mean, every I mean, CEOs, they don't want to use AI. Heads of state, heads of government say they want to use AI. We've never had consumers like that. I mean, we nor historically, we don't deal with CEOs. Now we deal with CEOs. Now we deal with heads of government and heads of state. On this because AI is so important. And letting people have you know, use AI on top of their data. That is what they want to do. But they didn't know how to do it securely. They didn't know how to well, they didn't know how to do it, period. And then one of the big risks was, oh my god. I can't share my JPMorgan Chase can't share all of its data. Goldman Sachs can't share all of its data with OpenAI. They won't do it. So or XAI or LAMA or, you know, Meta. They won't it's got to keep it private. So we've got to keep your private data private. We've got to keep your private data secure. But we have to make it available for inferencing by the latest and best reasoning models from OpenAI and XAI and everyone else. And because we have the database, because we can vectorize all the data in the database, because we have very elaborate security models in our database, in the Oracle database, we can do all that. We can deliver all that. And then what we chose to do was to with the AI database was not only make sure we can vectorize all the data so it can be understood by the AI model, we then bundled it with all of the AI models. That's why we did a deal with Google. That's why we did all of these deals where, you know, Gemini you can get Gemini from the Oracle Cloud. You can get from the Oracle Cloud. You can get from the Oracle Cloud. You get Walmart from the Oracle Cloud. I could go on. So we bundled them together. So it's very easy for our customers to use these large language models on a combination. And that's what they want is a combination of all of the publicly available data and all of their enterprise data. Which allows them to ask and get answered any question they can think of, any question that's important to them. Everyone wants it. I think the demand is going to be insatiable. But we can deliver a lot of databases and a lot of AI across our cloud over the next several years. We're in a good position to do that.
Safra Catz: And this is going to be one of the reasons that Oracle databases, which are still the bulk of the enterprise market by a lot, are going to finally move into the cloud. Many of them will move in the public cloud using the Oracle AI database, but many and the largest enterprises will want their own either dedicated regions or Oracle Cloud at customer. And, again, they can finally get the benefit of AI for their own data using any LLM that they want because they're all in our cloud too.
Alex Zukin: It sounds like very high margin AI revenue, guys. Congratulations.
Safra Catz: Thank you. Thank you. Okay.
Ken Bond: Thanks, Alex. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for twenty-four hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Tiffany for closing.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

2. Supported outcomes (management comments explicitly addressed and confirmed by numbers)
- Management said RPO “now top $455 billion… up 359% YoY and up $317 billion sequentially.” Past RPO ($99B in 2025‑Q1) and the provided historical RPO growth references confirm this is a very large increase — the numbers support management’s claim of a major RPO step‑up.
- Management said “Our cloud RPO grew nearly 500% on top of 83% growth last year.” Past references to cloud RPO >80% in 2025‑Q1 and 56%/80% sequencing in 2025‑Q4 align with management’s historical baseline; the reported nearly 500% is a clear acceleration and the historical values confirm the comparison baseline.
- Management said “Total cloud revenue… was up 27% to $7.2 billion.” Prior cloud revenue ($5.6B in 2025‑Q1 and $6.2B in 2025‑Q3) confirms the current $7.2B is a higher absolute amount and that cloud growth has continued / modestly accelerated.
- Management noted OCI consumption was up 57% and demand outstrips supply. Historical OCI growth (~56% in earlier references) confirms the growth trend; current 57% is consistent with and slightly above that trend.
- Bottom‑line improvements confirmed by numbers:
  - Non‑GAAP EPS improved from $1.39 (2025‑Q1) to $1.47 (2026‑Q1) — supports management’s point that earnings (non‑GAAP) strengthened.
  - Operating cash flow (trailing 12 months) rose from ~$19.1B to $21.5B — confirms improved cash generation on an operating basis.
- Areas where figures do not support a favorable historical comparison:
  - Free cash flow materially worsened (trailing FCF moved from +$11.3B to negative $5.9B), driven by elevated CapEx — this contradicts any simple “improving cash flow” narrative and is confirmed by the numbers.
  - GAAP EPS is marginally lower ($1.03 prior vs $1.01 current) — so GAAP bottom line is not an improvement versus the comparable quarter.

Summary (concise)
- Revenue and cloud metrics: clear improvement — total revenue, cloud revenue, infrastructure and cloud DB metrics are higher than recent comparable quarters.
- Bookings (RPO and cloud RPO): dramatic acceleration; current RPO and cloud RPO growth are much larger than the prior-year baselines.
- Earnings / cash: non‑GAAP EPS and operating cash flow improved; GAAP EPS is slightly lower. Free cash flow deteriorated sharply due to very large CapEx.
- Management comparisons about RPO, cloud RPO, cloud revenue, OCI growth, and EPS improvements are supported by the historical numbers; the adverse FCF impact from CapEx is likewise supported.

2. 支持的結果（管理層有明確歷史比較且數字確認）
- 管理層表示 RPO 現在超過 $4550 億、同比上升 359%、連季增加 $3170 億。過去 RPO ($990 億, 2025‑Q1) 與歷史 RPO 成長參考確認這是一個大幅增加，數字支持管理層關於 RPO 的比較陳述。
- 管理層表示 cloud RPO 成長近 500%，基礎為去年 ~83%。過去 cloud RPO 超過 80%（2025‑Q1）及 56%/80% 的連續參考，確認了管理層使用的歷史基線，且當前報告的近 500% 表示顯著加速。
- 管理層表示「總雲端營收為 $72 億，成長 27%」。過去雲端營收 $56 億（2025‑Q1）與 $62 億（2025‑Q3）確認目前 $72 億 為更高的絕對值，支持管理層的陳述。
- 管理層指出 OCI 消費上升 57 並且需求超過供給。過去 OCI 成長約 56% 的資料與當前 57% 相符，支持其成長論述。
- 關於底線改善（重點）：
  - 非 GAAP EPS 從 $1.39（2025‑Q1）上升到 $1.47（2026‑Q1）— 數字支持管理層關於盈利改善的說法（非 GAAP 基準）。
  - 營運現金流（過去 12 個月）從 ~$191B 上升到 $215B — 支持營運現金產生能力的改善說法。
- 與管理層期望不一致或需要注意：
  - 自由現金流明顯惡化（由正轉為負，主要因大幅增加的 CapEx），數字支持這一負面影響的實際情況。
  - GAAP EPS 輕微下降（$1.03 → $1.01），因此 GAAP 基礎下的底線並未改善，此點由數字確認。

摘要（簡潔）
- 營收與雲端指標：整體改善明顯 — 總營收、雲端及基礎設施、雲端資料庫指標均高於最近可比季度。
- 訂單/預訂（RPO 與 cloud RPO）：大幅加速，當前 RPO 與 cloud RPO 成長遠高於去年基線。
- 盈利 / 現金：非 GAAP EPS 與營運現金流改善；GAAP EPS 輕微下降；自由現金流因大幅 CapEx 顯著惡化。
- 管理層關於 RPO、cloud RPO、雲端營收、OCI 成長與 EPS 改善的比較敘述，被歷史數字所支持；同時，CapEx 導致的自由現金流惡化亦由數據確認。

Historical‑Calls note:
1) Validate past guidances (prior forward-looking statements) — met / beat / missed in 2026‑Q1
- Expected OCI revenue growth for FY2026 (previous: “Over 70%”, 2025‑Q4) — Beat / raised
  - Reason: Management in 2025‑Q4 guided OCI growth “over 70%” for FY2026. In 2026‑Q1 management now expects OCI to grow 77% to $18.0B for FY2026, i.e., a higher, more specific target than the prior “over 70%” statement (77% vs >70%).

(Other prior forward‑looking items in the historical set (Q2 guidance ranges, FY2025 CapEx language, full‑year FY2025 “double digits”, etc.) refer to different periods or to full fiscal‑year outcomes and therefore cannot be directly evaluated against a single quarter (2026‑Q1) result — omitted per instructions.)

2) Compare results discussed — concrete comparisons (most recent historical quarter prioritized)
- Remaining performance obligations (RPO)
  - Prior (2025‑Q1): RPO reported at $99 billion (RPO grew ~52% CC). 
  - Current (2026‑Q1): RPO now $455 billion, up 359% YoY and up $317 billion sequentially from Q4.

- Cloud RPO growth
  - Prior (2025‑Q4 / 2025‑Q1 signals): cloud RPO growth previously reported in the tens of percent (examples: “cloud RPO grew more than 80%” in 2025‑Q1; 56% cited in 2025‑Q4).
  - Current (2026‑Q1): “Cloud RPO grew nearly 500% on top of 83% growth last year.”
  - Comparison: Cloud RPO acceleration is dramatic — from prior ~50–80% growth to nearly 500% YoY in 2026‑Q1.

- Total cloud revenue (SaaS + IaaS)
  - Prior (2025‑Q1): Total cloud revenue ~$5.6B (up ~22% YoY).

  - Current (2026‑Q1): OCI consumption revenue up 57%; cloud infrastructure revenue $3.3B, up 54% YoY (on top of 46% last year).
  - Comparison: OCI growth in 2026‑Q1 (~57%) is similar to mid‑to‑high‑50s reported in recent quarters, while infrastructure revenue dollar run‑rate has risen ($3.3B).

- Cloud database services (annualized run‑rate)
  - Prior (2025‑Q1): Cloud database services annual revenue ~$2.1B (up 23%).
  - Current (2026‑Q1): Annualized revenues nearly $2.8B; up 32% YoY.
  - Comparison: Annualized cloud DB revenue grew from ~$2.1B to ~$2.8B, with growth rate increasing (23% → 32%).

- Autonomous Database
  - Prior (2025‑Q1): Autonomous Database growth was reported previously (~26% referenced as “last year”).
  - Current (2026‑Q1): Autonomous Database revenue up 43% (on top of 26% growth in Q1 last year).
  - Comparison: Autonomous Database growth accelerated materially (26% prior → 43% current).

- Multi‑cloud database revenue
  - Prior: No directly comparable historical figure in the provided set.
  - Current (2026‑Q1): Multi‑cloud database revenue grew 1,529% in Q1 (new, large expansion).

- Cloud application / strategic back‑office application revenue
  - Prior (2025‑Q1): SaaS / application revenue around $3.5B (SaaS) and strategic back‑office annualized revenue $8.2B (2025‑Q1).
  - Current (2026‑Q1): Cloud application revenue $3.8B, up 10%; strategic back‑office application revenue $2.4B for the quarter, up 16%.

- Non‑GAAP tax rate impact
  - Prior (2025‑Q2): Non‑GAAP tax rate increased to ~20.1% (one‑time variance noted).
  - Current (2026‑Q1): Non‑GAAP tax rate 20.5% (vs 19% guidance), causing EPS to be $0.03 lower.
  - Comparison: Tax rate remains elevated vs base guidance (20.1% prior → 20.5% current), producing a small EPS drag.

- Operating cash flow (quarter and trailing 12/4 quarters)
  - Prior (2025‑Q1): Operating cash flow for Q1 ~$7.4B; trailing‑12 months ~$19.1B.
  - Current (2026‑Q1): Operating cash flow Q1 $8.1B; last four quarters $21.5B, up 13%.
  - Comparison: Q1 operating cash flow rose ~$7.4B → $8.1B; trailing OCF grew ~$19.1B → $21.5B.

- Free cash flow and CapEx
  - Prior (2025‑Q1 / 2025‑Q4): Trailing free cash flow previously positive (e.g., $11.3B trailing‑12 as of 2025‑Q1); Q4 free cash flow was negative (‑$2.9B) due to higher CapEx.
  - Current (2026‑Q1): Free cash flow for last four quarters negative $5.9B with $27.4B of CapEx; Q1 free cash flow negative $362M with CapEx $8.5B.
  - Comparison: Free cash flow swung from positive trailing levels (~$11.3B) to negative (‑$5.9B) as CapEx has ramped massively (quarter CapEx $2.3B prior quarter → $8.5B in Q1; trailing CapEx $27.4B).

- Short‑term deferred revenue
  - Prior (2025‑Q2): Short‑term deferred revenue ~$9.4B (up 8%).

1) 驗證過去的指引（先前之前瞻性陳述）— 在 2026‑Q1 的結果屬於達成 / 超越 / 未達
- 對 FY2026 的 OCI 營收成長預期（先前：2025‑Q4 說「超過 70%」） — 超越 / 上修
  - 原因：公司在 2025‑Q4 對 FY2026 指出 OCI 成長「超過 70%」。在 2026‑Q1 管理層將預期上修為成長 77%、達 $18.0B，亦即較先前的「超過 70%」更高且更具體（77% vs >70%）。

(其他歷史的前瞻性項目（Q2 範圍、FY2025 CapEx 表述、FY2025「雙位數」等）屬不同時段或整年度預測，無法以單一季度（2026‑Q1）直接比對 — 因此依指示略過。)

Peers note:
English

- Fact 2 — Cloud RPO growth
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle reports an outsized acceleration (nearly 500% RPO growth on top of 83% prior-year growth), far larger than RPO growth rates reported by peers, indicating a very different scale and pace of backlog expansion.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Our cloud RPO grew nearly 500% on top of 83% growth last year." Comparable historical calls: Fortinet reported Total RPO growth of "12%" and Current RPO growth of "15%" (FTNT Q2025‑Q2).

- Fact 3 — Total cloud revenue, Q1 ($7.2B, +27%)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found in the provided history; Oracle emphasizes large absolute cloud revenue ($7.2B) with strong mid‑20s growth, which is a much larger cloud revenue base than many peers disclose.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Total cloud revenue ... was up 27% to $7.2 billion." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 4 — Cloud infrastructure revenue, Q1 ($3.3B, +54% YoY)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle's cloud infrastructure (OCI) revenue and growth are orders of magnitude larger and faster-growing than the single‑digit/low‑hundreds‑of‑millions cloud infra figures cited by peers.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Cloud infrastructure revenue was $3.3 billion, up 54%..." Comparable historical call: Akamai reported "Revenue for cloud infrastructure services ... $81 million, up 39% year‑over‑year" (AKAM Q2025‑Q3).

- Fact 5 — OCI consumption revenue growth (+57%)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found in the provided history; Oracle reports very strong consumption growth and says demand "dramatically outstrip[s] supply," positioning OCI as experiencing unusually high demand intensity relative to peers.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "OCI consumption revenue was up 57% and demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 6 — Cloud database services run‑rate (~$2.8B annualized; +32%)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle highlights a large, fast‑growing cloud database revenue run‑rate, reflecting a more mature, higher‑value cloud database business than peers in the sample disclose.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Cloud database services, which were up 32%, now have annualized revenues of nearly $2.8 billion." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 7 — Autonomous Database revenue (+43% on top of prior +26%)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle points to accelerating sequential multiyear growth in a specialized database product, implying product‑level strength that peers did not quantify similarly.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Autonomous Database revenue was up 43% on top of the 26% growth reported in Q1 last year." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 8 — Multi‑cloud database revenue (+1529%)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle reports an extremely large percentage increase in multi‑cloud database revenue (1,529%), a hyper‑accelerating niche metric that far exceeds typical peer growth rates reported for cloud subsegments.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Multi‑cloud database revenue ... grew 1529% in Q1." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 9 — Cloud application revenue ($3.8B, +10%)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle shows modest mid‑single‑digit to low‑double‑digit cloud apps growth on a multi‑billion base, whereas peers in dataset either report different segments or much smaller absolute amounts.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Cloud application revenue was $3.8 billion, up 10%." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 10 — Strategic back‑office application revenue ($2.4B, +16%)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle documents solid double‑digit growth in strategic back‑office apps on a large base, again larger in scale than peer disclosures in the sample.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Strategic back‑office application revenue was $2.4 billion, up 16%." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 11 — Total software revenue ($5.7B, down 2%)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle shows a software decline despite strong cloud growth, a mixed profile that peers in the dataset did not present for the same period.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Total software revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, down 2%." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 12 — Total revenue ($14.9B, +11% YoY)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle reports healthy overall revenue growth driven by large cloud and infra gains, producing a much larger company‑level revenue than many peers.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Total revenues for the quarter were $14.9 billion, up 11% from last year." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 16 — Operating cash flow, last 4 quarters ($21.5B, +13%)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found in the provided history; Oracle shows very large operating cash flow and growth, a scale above the peer examples.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "For the last four quarters, operating cash flow was up 13% to $21.5 billion." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 17 — Free cash flow (last 4 quarters negative $5.9B) and CapEx ($27.4B)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle reports a large negative free cash flow driven by very large CapEx; peers also show negative FCF when CapEx ramps, but Oracle's magnitude and CapEx intensity are much larger.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Free cash flow was a negative $5.9 billion with $27.4 billion of CapEx." Comparable historical calls: Tesla reported "Negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter" driven by inventory and elevated CapEx (TSLA Q2024‑Q1); CooperCompanies reported "Free cash flow was $5 million with CapEx of $118 million" (COO Q2024‑Q1).

- Fact 20 — Cash and marketable securities (quarter‑end $11B)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle's cash balance is large but paired with very high CapEx and dividend payout, a liquidity posture not detailed by the peer examples.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "At quarter end, we had $11 billion in cash and marketable securities." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 21 — Short‑term deferred revenue balance ($12B, +5%)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle reports a very large deferred revenue balance with modest growth; peers report materially smaller deferred revenue balances in the examples.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Short‑term deferred revenue balance was $12 billion, up 5%." Comparable historical calls: GM reported "Deferred revenue ... $5 billion" (GM Q2025‑Q3); NetApp reported "Q3 deferred revenue was $4.1 billion" (NTAP Q2025‑Q3).

- Fact 24 — Dividends paid, last 12 months ($5B)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle returns very large absolute cash via dividends relative to peers in the dataset, reflecting much larger aggregate payouts.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "we paid out dividends of $5 billion over the last twelve months." Comparable historical calls: Texas Instruments reported "Total Dividends Paid $1.2 billion" in various quarters (TXN entries).

- Fact 25 — Quarterly dividend declared ($0.50 per share)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle's declared $0.50 quarterly dividend is within the range peers declare, but the absolute cash impact is larger given Oracle's payout history; peers show a variety of per‑share amounts (some lower, some higher).
  - Evidence: Oracle: "The board ... declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share." Comparable historical calls: Apple declared "$0.25 per share" (AAPL Q2024‑Q3); Dollar General declared "$0.59 per share" (DG Q2025‑Q2).

- Fact 28 — FY2026 CapEx guidance (~$35B; could be a little higher)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle projects a very large FY CapEx driven by cloud RPO growth, but its announced guidance is still smaller than the very large hyperscaler CapEx ranges reported by some peers.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "I now expect fiscal year 2026 CapEx will be around $35 billion... it could be a little higher." Comparable historical call: Meta guided "CapEx Guidance for 2025 $66 billion to $72 billion" (META Q2025‑Q2).

- Fact 30 — OCI revenue FY2026 (expected +77% to $18B)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle forecasts very high single‑year growth for a large infrastructure business, which is a faster‑than‑typical increase compared with the more modest full‑year outlook movements seen in the peer examples.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "We now expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year." Comparable: peer revenue outlooks in dataset are much smaller/moderate (no direct OCI peer).

- Fact 31 — OCI revenue multi‑year outlook ($32B, $73B, $114B, $144B)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle presents an aggressive multi‑year scale‑up trajectory to many tens of billions per year, far exceeding the scale or incremental outlook ranges in the peer dataset.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "And then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the following four years." Comparable historical calls: various peers provided multi‑year/full‑year outlooks in the low billions (examples include GDDY, IDXX, TPR targeted ranges in the single‑ to low‑billion range).

- Fact 33 — FY2026 total revenue growth guidance (16% constant currency)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle is guiding to mid‑teens full‑year revenue growth (16% CC), which is higher than some peer guidance examples that targeted lower single‑digit to low‑double‑digit ranges.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "For fiscal year 2026, we remain confident and committed to ... total revenue growth of 16% in constant currency." Comparable historical call: HPE guided "7% to 11%" for fiscal 2025 revenue growth (HPE Q2025‑Q1).

- Fact 36 & 37 — Q2 total revenue growth guidance (12–14% CC; ~14% USD with ~1% FX tailwind)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle is guiding mid‑teens qtr outlook with an explicit FX tailwind callout, while peers in dataset provided different ranges for different companies.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Total revenue is expected to grow from 12% to 14% in constant currency" and "expected to grow 14% ... in US dollars ... a 1% positive effect on revenue." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 38 & 39 — Q2 total cloud revenue growth guidance (32–36% CC; 33–37% USD)
  - How Oracle differs: No directly comparable peer statement found; Oracle is forecasting very strong quarter cloud growth in the 30%+ range, larger than incremental cloud segment guidance in the peer examples.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 32% to 36% in constant currency" / "33% to 37% in US dollars." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

- Fact 40 & 41 — Q2 non‑GAAP EPS guidance (8–10% CC; $1.58–$1.62; 10–12% USD; $1.61–$1.65)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle's EPS guidance is mid‑single‑digit to low‑double‑digit growth with explicit per‑share ranges; peers provide EPS ranges that can be similar in absolute amount but often on different scales—Oracle's per‑share figures are consistent with its larger company size and guidance cadence.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "Non‑GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 10% and be between $1.58 and $1.62 in constant currency" and "10% to 12% and be between $1.61 and $1.65 in USD." Comparable historical calls: Akamai guided "Q2 Non‑GAAP EPS $1.52 to $1.58" (AKAM Q2025‑Q1); eBay had "Non‑GAAP EPS for Q4 $1.17 to $1.22" (EBAY Q2024‑Q3).

- Fact 26 — Oracle’s status in AI workloads (signed significant cloud contracts)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle highlights prominent hyperscaler and AI partner contracts (OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD) as evidence of commercial traction; peers quantify AI application revenue (e.g., TEL reporting "Above $700 million") whereas Oracle emphasizes strategic contract wins and embedded multi‑cloud placements rather than a single disclosed AI revenue number.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "We have signed significant cloud contracts with ... OpenAI, xAI, Meta, NVIDIA, AMD, and many others." Comparable historical call: Telnor/TEL noted "Revenue from AI Applications 'Above $700 million'" as a quantified AI revenue example (TEL Q2025‑Q2).

- Fact 32 — Multi‑cloud data centers expansion (34 live; plan +37 = 71)
  - How Oracle differs: Oracle provides a specific, large multi‑cloud physical expansion plan (34 live, 71 total planned), a level of multi‑cloud colocated footprint detail that peers in the sample did not present.
  - Evidence: Oracle: "With 34 multi‑cloud data centers now live ... we will deliver another 37 data centers for a total of 71." Comparable: no matched peer metric in dataset.

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

---

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2025 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Yuka Broderick: Thank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's third quarter 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future financial performance, our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2025 and related notes and assumptions, our gross margins and operating margins, our product capabilities and our ability to capitalize on market opportunities. The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank all of you for joining us this morning to go through our results for Q3. Let me begin with this quarter's business drivers. We have seen broad-based positive trends in the demand environment with an ongoing strength of cloud migration and digital transformation. Against this backdrop, we executed a very strong Q3 both in new logo bookings and usage growth of existing customers. As a notable inflection, we saw acceleration of year-over-year revenue growth across our non AI customers. And the sequential usage growth for non-AI existing customers was the highest we have seen going back 12 quarters. This growth was broad-based as our customers are adopting more products and getting more value from the Datadog platform. We also experienced strong revenue growth for our AI native customers and a broadening contribution to growth among those customers. There, too, we saw an acceleration of growth in our AI cohort in Q3 when excluding our largest customer. Looking at new business. Contribution from new customers increased in Q3 in both the amount of new customer bookings as well as the revenue contribution from new customers. And as usual, churn has remained low with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers. Regarding our Q3 financial performance and key metrics. Revenue was $886 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended Q3 with about 32,000 customers up from about 29,200 a year ago. We also ended with about 4,060 customers with an ARR of $100,000 more, up from about 3,490 a year ago. These customers generated about 89% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $214 million with a free cash flow margin of 24%. Turning to customer adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q3, 84% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 83% a year ago. 54% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 49% a year ago. 31% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 26% a year ago and 16% of our customers were using 8 or products, up from 12% a year ago. Digital experience is an example of an area within our platform where our rapid piece of innovation is turning into tangible value for our customers. Our digital experience products include RUM or Real User Monitoring, to observe and improve application behavior in mobile and web apps, synthetics to stimulate user flows and proactively detect user facing issues and product analytics to help users connect application behavior to business impact. Over the years, we built our product breadth and depth in this area, and that is being recognized in the marketplace. For the second year in a row, Datadog has been named the leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Monitoring. We are pleased that today, these digital experience products together exceed $300 million in ARR. And this includes, in particular, a very fast ramp for product analytics, which has already seen adoption by more than 1,000 customers. We also want to call out our security suite of products where we are executing and accelerating growth. Security ARR growth was in the mid-50s as a percentage year-over-year in Q3, up from the mid-40s we mentioned last quarter. We're starting to see success in including Cloud SIEM in larger deals, and we'll get back to that in a bit in our customer examples. And we're seeing positive trends beyond Cloud SIEM, including fast uptake of good security and an increasing number of wins in cloud security. Overall, we saw year-over-year growth acceleration in each one of our security products. Moving on to R&D. We continue to deliver on what is a very ambitious AI road map. We are seeing high customer interest in our Bits AI agents, which we announced at our DASH user conference in June. We have now onboarded thousands of customers for preview access, the Bits AI SRE agent. And as we prepare for general availability, we are getting very enthusiastic feedback on the time and cost savings enabled by Bits AI. As RUM user recently told us, with Bits AI SRE being on call 24/7 for us, meantime to resolution for our services has improved significantly. For most cases, the investigation is already taken care of well before our engineers sit down and open their laptops to assess the issue. And this is not an isolated comment. We see the potential here for our agents who radically transform observability and operations. In LLM observability, we recently launched LLM experiments and playgrounds for general availability, helping teams to rapidly iterate on LLM applications and AI agents. We also launched custom LLM as a judge evaluations for general availability, which lets customers write evaluation prompts to access application quality and safety. As an illustration of growth and adoption in the past few months, the number of LLM spans customers are sending to Datadog has more than quadrupled. And we are seeing a lot of interest in the Datadog MCP servers. Our MCP server acts as a bridge between Datadog and AI agents, such as Codex OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Goose by Block and many more. Our preview customers are using real-time production data context to drive trouble shooting, root causes analysis and automation in these agents. One user told us, the Datadog MCP server is a great tool. It enables me to get the last 5 of my app and follow the spans and traces all the way to the root cause. I have never been more hooked on Datadog. So we see MCP adoption as a great way to cement Datadog even further into our customers' workflows. Finally, we continue to see rising customer interest for next-gen AI observability with over 5,000 customers sending us AI data to one or more of AI integrations. On the topic of integrations, we are very proud to now support over 1,000 integrations, which we believe is unparalleled in our space. By using our integrations, customer call it otherwise disparate data sources across Datadog products for deeper analysis. We can see from a customers usage that this is a critical part of the Datadog platform. Our 32,000 customers use more than 50 integrations on average, while customers spending over $1 million annually with us use more than 150. And most importantly, as tech stack evolves, we continue to update and expand our integrations. So our customers can use Datadog to deploy new technologies with confidence. Last but not least, I wanted to give a shout out to our AI research team for the amazing work they have published. Our TOTO OpenWave time-series forecasting model has been one of the top downloads on Hugging Face over the past few months, and that is across all categories. It is very impactful as, among other things, the high quality of this work allows us to attract world-class AI researchers and engineers. Now let's move on to sales and marketing. We had a number of great new logo wins in customer expansion this quarter. So I'll go through a few of them. First, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a leading European telco, our largest ever land deal in Europe. This company's previous setup was expensive, inefficient and wasn't scaling to meet their needs. By using Datadog, they expect to save over $1 million annually on tool cost alone, along with millions of dollars more in reduced operation costs, lower engineering time and avoidance of revenue loss. They will adopt 11 Datadog products to start, and we consolidate more than 10 commercial and open source tools. Next, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a leading financial risk and analytics company. The company's fragmented tooling has led to major incidents that sometimes took multiple days and hundreds of engineers to resolve. They plan to start with 11 Datadog products including On-Call, Cloud SIEM and Bits AI, and will replace 14 commercial open source and hyperscale observability tools. Next, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a Fortune 500 technology hardware company. This is an exciting win for new -- sorry. This is an exciting win for our new go-to-market motions, targeting the largest and most sophisticated companies in the world. Datadog has been chosen as their strategic observability partner, and we are displacing commercial tools across availability, cloud team and incident response. This customer is starting with 14 Datadog products. Next, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 500 financial services company. This customer has pockets of siloed teams and data, including one business unit, which manually hosted and maintained 93 separate instances of open source tooling. With this expansion, this company will adopt 15 Datadog products, including all 3 pillars in all of their business units. They will also replace their SIEM solution with Datadog Cloud SIEM in a 7-figure land deal for Cloud SIEM. And by bringing all their telemetry data into the Datadog platform, they expect better insights for their adoption of Bits AI SRE Agents today and Bits AI [indiscernible]. Next, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 500 heavy equipment company. With this expansion, this customer will replace its open source log solution with Datadog log management and Flex logs. They plan to adopt LLM Observability and their IT team is using cloud cost management to improve cost visibility and governance. Next, we will come back a leading vertical SaaS company with a 7-figure analyze deal. By returning to Datadog, this customer benefits from our alignment with open telemetry and we'll implement the incident and reliability processes that they were unable to execute on previously. Next, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a major American carmaker. This customer is adopting Datadog products faster than previously expected and this agreement supports the higher usage. With this expansion, they will adopt Datadog incident management and On-Call solution company-wide for a total of 5,000 users who support operational continuity across the business. Finally, we signed a 9-figure annualized expansion with a leading AI company. This company has been a long-time Datadog customer and has expanded their usage of multiple products, securing better economics for a higher commitment with an early renewal. Speaking of AI customers, we continue to help AI native customers big and small to grow and scale their businesses. And we continue to see this group broaden in number and size with more than 500 AI native companies in this group, but 100 of which are spending more than $100,000 annually with Datadog and more than 15 who are spending more than $1 million annually with us. While we know there's a lot of attention on this cohort, we primarily see it as an indication of what's to come as companies of every size and every single industry incorporate AI into their cloud applications. And that's it for another very strong quarter from our go-to-market teams, who are now very hard at work as we have a really exciting pipeline for Q4. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, I want to say a few words on our longer-term outlook. There is no change to our overall view that digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business. Meanwhile, we are advancing rapidly in AI, where we are incredibly excited about our opportunities. We're building a comprehensive set of AI Observability products to help our customers tackle the higher complexity that comes with these technologies. And we are building AI into Datadog, and I spoke earlier about the excitement our customers have for our Bits AI agents. The market opportunity in cloud and AI is expected to grow rapidly into the trillions of dollars and companies of every size and industry are looking to adopt AI to deliver value to their customers and drive positive business outcome. So we're moving fast to help our customers develop, deploy and grow into the cloud and into the AI world. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?
David Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. To start, our Q3 revenue was $886 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q3 revenue growth. First, overall, we saw sequential usage growth from existing customers in Q3 that was higher than our expectations and the strongest in 12 quarters in our non-AI native customer base. We saw year-over-year growth acceleration broadly across our business, including in new logos and existing customers, both enterprise and SMB, with customers across our spending bands, big and small, and customers in a wide variety of industries. Next, we saw strong and accelerating contribution from new customers. New logo annualized bookings more than doubled year-over-year and set a new record driven by an increase in average new logo land size, particularly in enterprise. We believe we are starting to see the benefits of our growth of sales capacity. And we are seeing new logos ramping faster, contributing more to revenue growth. The portion of our year-over-year revenue growth that related to new customers was about 25% in Q3, up from 20% in Q2. Next, our AI native customers continue to exhibit rapid growth, while more customers in this group are growing to be sizable customers. As Olivier discussed, we extended the contract of our largest AI native customer. In addition, we now have more larger AI customers, including 15 of them spending $1 million or more annually with Datadog, and about 100 spending more than $100,000 annually. Year-over-year revenue growth from our AI native customers, excluding the largest customer, again, accelerated in Q3. In Q3, this group represented 12% of our revenue, up from 11% last quarter and about 6% in the year ago quarter. I will note that over time, we think this metric will become less relevant as AI usage in production broadens beyond this group of customers. Our year-over-year revenue growth also accelerated amongst our non-AI native customers. In Q3, our revenue growth, excluding the AI native customer group, was 20% year-over-year, accelerating from 18% year-over-year in Q2, and we have seen this trend of accelerating growth continue in October. Regarding retention metrics. Our trailing 12-month net revenue retention percentage was 120% similar to last quarter and our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remain in the mid- to high 90s. And now moving on to our financial results. Our billings were $893 million, up 30% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO was $2.79 billion, up 53% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the low 50s percentage year-over-year. Our strong bookings contributed to this acceleration of RPO. We continue to believe that revenue is a better indication of our trends in our business than billings and RPO. And now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $719 million, and our gross margin was 81.2%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.9% last quarter and 81.1% in the year ago quarter. As previously mentioned, we continue to see the impact of our engineers cost-saving efforts in Q3 as they deliver on our cloud efficiency project. Our Q3 OpEx grew 30% -- 32% excuse me, year-over-year, down from 36% last quarter. We continue to grow our investments to pursue our long-term growth opportunities, and this OpEx growth is an indication of our execution on our hiring plan. Q3 operating income was $207 million for a 23% operating margin compared to 20% last quarter and 25% in the year ago quarter. And now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash flow from operations was $251 billion in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $214 million for a free cash flow margin of 24%. And now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2025. First, our guidance velocity overall remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and imply conservatism on these growth trends. So for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $912 million to $916 million, which represents a 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $216 million to $220 million, which implies an operating margin of 24%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56 per share based on approximately 367 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year -- fiscal year 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $3.386 billion to $3.390 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $754 million to $758 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.02 per share, based on 364 million weighted average diluted shares. And finally, some additional notes on our guidance. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2025 to be approximately $170 million. We continue to expect cash taxes in 2025 to be about $10 million to $20 million and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 and going forward. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 4% of revenues in fiscal year 2025. To summarize, we are pleased with our execution in Q3. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, including their adoption of AI. And I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs.
Kasthuri Rangan: Appreciate it. Congratulations on the spectacular results and showing sequential improvement across the board. Olivier, I had a question for you. We've talked about GPU monetization versus CPU monetization. So how closer are we to the point where you can confidently expand and get your share of the customer wallet when it comes to whether it's training workload, inferencing workload on the GPU clusters, which are becoming more prevalent and increasingly a larger part of the compute build-out in the future? That's it for me.
Olivier Pomel: Yes. So we have products that are getting into the market now for GPU monitoring. But these don't generate any significant revenue yet. So all the revenues we've shared, like the acceleration, et cetera, that's not related to us capitalizing more on GPUs, that's a future opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley.
Sanjit Singh: Congrats on the acceleration in growth this quarter. Olivier, I wanted to talk about some of those enterprise trends you're seeing in sort of your non-AI cohort. What do you sort of put the improved performance in growth this quarter on? You mentioned that the sales productivity or the benefit from some of the sales investments starting to come online. Is there sort of an uplift in sort of the cloud migration trends as you're starting to see enterprise build more AI applications. I'd just love to get your perspective on the underlying trends in the enterprise and the mid-market business.
Olivier Pomel: Yes. I'd say there's 3 parts to it. One part is the demand environment is not -- is positive in general. I don't know that we see massive acceleration of cloud migration, but at least the environment is not pushing the other way. We know which happens from time to time. So that's point number one. Point number two is we've been growing sales capacity quite a bit, and we've created new go-to-market motions to go after the kind of customers who were not getting before. Like we've done quite a bit of investment over the past couple of years and we see that starting to pay off. As I said also, we feel good about Q4 in terms of pipeline on the sales side. So it's too early to tell yet. We still have to close those deals, but we feel good about the scaling of our go-to-market. And point number three is we have a number of products that we've been developing over the years. Some of them are early, some of them a little bit further along that are really clicking. We see -- we have a lot of success with getting large enterprises to adopt Flex Logs, for example. We have a lot of success in some of new products such as analytics that we mentioned on the call. We're seeing some large land deals with our cloud team. So all of that is contributing to the picture you're seeing today.
Sanjit Singh: And just as a follow-up on the AI observability opportunity. When you look at some of the independent software vendors that are releasing Agentic solutions, Agentic portfolios. A number of them are including observability as part of their sort of value proposition. Is there any work you think Datadog has to do to sort of infiltrate that market or make sure that customers look to Datadog as that Agentic monitoring capability as some of these independent software vendors try to bundle in observability into their solutions. I would love to get your perspective on that?
Olivier Pomel: Yes. I mean there's absolutely no doubt to us that the customers will even want a unified platform for observability for all of this. There's 2 parts to that. One is, historically, every single piece of software we integrate with, whether that's SaaS or things that customers on themselves, also has its own management control and observability control. But you're not going to log into [ 70 ] or in the case of customers we mentioned that they use 60 integrations for the smaller customers, 150 integrations for the larger ones. It's not practical to actually go and manage that separately. So we think all of that belongs in a central place, and that's the historical trend we've seen. We also think that you can't separate the AI parts from the non-AI parts of the business. So you're not going to look at your agents separately that you do at your web hosting and your database and your -- everything else you have in your stack. So all of that in the end will be attached to observability.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow: Perfect. Congrats from me as well. That sounded like an amazing quarter and nice to see it coming together. On the AI side, and I don't want to talk about the customer, but more the other ones, like 15 customers over 1 million. That's like a big number and 100 over 100,000. How do we have to think about the nature of those? Is this kind of -- are those kind of especially the bigger ones of those kind of model builders, but then even 15 is a big number. And over 100 sounds like this whole new application world that we've all been kind of waiting for starting to come together. Is that kind of what's going on there? Because it does sound quite exciting and much more broader than we thought.
Olivier Pomel: It's actually fairly broad. So there is model vendors, there's models -- model that can be the lens model that can be video, it can be sound generation, it can be all of the various parts of the stack you see as independent companies. It can be -- there's quite a few companies that do that work on the coding side. So coding assistants and vibe coders and everything in that range. Some of these are very new companies. Some of these are not very new companies, some of these started 5, 7, 8 years ago. And we're sort of not necessarily AI native from day 1, but very quickly, that would give them the growth they see today with the people to AI. So we see a little bit of that. We have companies that are other parts of the stack in AI on the, say, the [ steady ] side, the other components of the infrastructure. And we have other companies that are purely applications filled with AI. So we have a bit of everything in there. Like it's actually fairly representative of the space.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan.
Mark Murphy: You had mentioned the expansion of the contract with your largest AI native customer and I believe you said better economics for a higher commitment. Can you speak to that because I would assume a higher commitment would carry a volume-based discount. I'm just trying to understand if. For some reason, if that was not the case here, what did you mean by better economics? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Olivier Pomel: Yes. I mean, this is without getting to the detail of any specific customer like this is the motion is always the same, like customers grow, they commit to more, they get better prices. So you see, like a, again, talking about customers in general, you see both of usage, drops in revenue as customers renew and get higher commit and a better price and then usually growth after that for those customers. That's the motion that we've had. We have about 30,000 customers so far.
Mark Murphy: Okay. And the -- what in that, so the better economics part of it is just where it's going to be netting out like 12 months down the road? Is that what you mean?
Olivier Pomel: Well, the bigger economics means you commit tomorrow, you get a better price. And as we -- remember, we have a usage model. So we charge people every month on what they use at the price we agreed. So if you get better economics, and your usage is somewhat similar month to month, one month and the next that you pay less, but the overall backdrop of our business is increased consumption.
Mark Murphy: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, Olivier, the acceleration that you saw in the security growth is pretty noticeable too. We recall, I think about 6 months ago, you had ramped up and engaged a lot more of a channel partners, which is a key ingredient to grow in the security business. Is it a function of that? Or is there a mindset change happening out there where customers want observability to be the central point of collection so that all the security teams and the ops teams are working with the same set of metrics and logs and tracers?
Olivier Pomel: Look, I think it's a number of things. Definitely, we've been investing in the channel, and that's certainly helpful to do the security business as a whole. The win -- the big win we mentioned on security that we mentioned a couple of wins in Cloud SIEM. These tends to be more related to product maturity. The strength of our underlying platform, especially when it comes to technology like Flex Logs, for example. And the fact also that we've been learning how to properly go to market for security. And I think we see things clicking in a way that is exciting.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi.
Fatima Boolani: Oli, I'll start with you and I have a follow-up for Dave. On the On-Call product, Oli, how do agentic advancements in general detract or enhance the value proposition here? And I'm very simplistically thinking about the core nature and value proposition of the On-Call product intelligently routing, requests for remediation, right? So how do you just broader advancements in AI, help beef up and/or detract your ability to monetize this product? And then just a follow-up for David, please.
Olivier Pomel: Well, I mean, if you zoom out, we entered the field with On-Call because we wanted to own the end-to-end incident resolution. So we wanted because we before that, we were detecting the incidents and sending the alerts, and then we were pretty much where the resolution happened after that. Customers were spending their time in data to diagnose and understand what was going on. So we wanted to own the full cycle. . And we thought that with AI, in particular, we'd have the ability to do things if we are on the whole cycle that we couldn't do otherwise. So what you see right now is, I mean, this resonates with customers, they adopting to product. We've mentioned like some exciting customers with say, [ one ] with 5,000 seats for On-Call, which is very exciting. But in the future, there's many more things we can do in working on for that product. If we both detect incident and notify, we can do some sort of things such as even predicting the incident and notifying early or rerouting early or telling people before the incident actually takes place, how they can potentially fix it. So these are all things we're working on. I mean, look, if you look at the various product announcements we've made, whether that's Bits AI or SRE or the time series forecasting model we have released. When you assemble all that, you get to a very, very interesting picture of what we can do in the future. So we're excited by that. Our customers are excited by the vision there too, and that's why these products are successful.
Fatima Boolani: Appreciate that. David, on net retention rates, why aren't we necessarily seeing more upward pressure on the metric, just given the strength of expansionary bookings that you alluded to in the quarter from the installed base. And I mean I suspect it's because it's a trailing 12-month metric. But any directional color you can just share on that. And any high-level commentary on some of the non-AI native net retention rate trend behavior?
David Obstler: Yes, you've nailed it. It's a trailing 12 months, it's a number that's rounded, it has the dynamics that you might expect in that the growth of the non-AI natives has been, as we mentioned, a combination of landing and expanding at higher rates than we've seen in recent quarters. So if that continues as you go into a trailing 12-month metric, you see a directional movement.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc.
Eric Heath: Oli, David, Bits AI seems like a really exciting thing out of Dash. And I know it's still in preview, but you mentioned there's a lot of interest there. So I'm just curious how you think about the agentic opportunity with Bits AI. How meaningful this can be for 2026 as a differentiator versus competition and also as a revenue contributor?
Olivier Pomel: Yes. So -- I mean, look, it's super exciting. The feedback is very good on it. I mean, we've been collecting all the -- so I read one quote, we have dozens that look just like that, that was sent to us by customers. And so that's very, very exciting. We also started having some customers buy and come to it to just to show value and to make sure we're on to the right product mix. And so we feel good that this is something that is high quality and we can monetize. In terms of the impact for next year, on the packaging side, I'm not completely sure yet whether the biggest impact will be seen from what we charge Bits AI itself or for the rest of the platform, that it gets benefits from the differentiation of Bits AI. I think that's more of a broader question of packaging and monetization of AI. And remember that we have a product that is usage based. So anything that drives usage up and adoption from customers is good for us and is very, very monetizable. But what we can tell is this is differentiating, this is good. It works significantly better than anything else we've seen or heard of in the market, and we are doubling down on it. We have many, many teams now working on deepening Bits AI SREs to making sure it goes further into the resolution doesn't just point to the issue, but fixes the code that all these kind of things working hard on that. We're also working on breadth, making sure that we train it on many more types of data, many types of sources, sometimes even systems that are observe the systems that are not dialed up, so we can cut across to other systems our customers are using. So we are very, very aggressively developing Bits AI SRE. It's resonating very well in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell of BTIG.
Gray Powell: Congratulations on the great results. So maybe just like taking a step back, if we go back to the beginning of the year, Datadog was expecting 19% revenue growth. It looks like you're tracking to something over 26% growth now, and that's just the high end of your guidance. So I guess my question is, what surprised you the most this year? And then just how do you feel about the sustainability of those drivers as you look forward?
Olivier Pomel: I mean, look, the -- so first, I apologize for over delivering on the results. We might do it again, but we'll see. I think the biggest surprise for us has been that -- so AI in general has or AI adoption has grown faster than we thought it would at the beginning of the year. So we've seen that across our AI cohort. We've seen also that we got some of our new products and new, like the changes we're making on the go-to-market side to click perhaps earlier than we would have thought otherwise. So all in all, we saw the leading part of the business with AI growth faster, not the lagging but the slower growing, more traditional part of the business also accelerate and that gets us where we are today.
David Obstler: And I'd add, we have a good demand environment and we've been investing whether it be in the products that Oli's been talking about or in the sales capacity we made clear that we were in investment and we're seeing those investments pay off.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda of Bank of America Securities.
Koji Ikeda: Just one from me here. I wanted to ask a question on the inflection in the non-AI native growth and how to think about the areas of strength in this cohort. Is it coming from your largest enterprises? Is it coming from a certain type of customer? Is there a common theme in the workloads that you're seeing or the products that are being added on that is driving that strength? Or is it just really just broad-based? What I'm trying to get out here is I'm really trying to understand more the durability of this growth reflection.
Olivier Pomel: So it is broad-based. And I think, again, speaks to a couple of things. It speaks to the fact that, in general, the demand environment is good. Though I would say, there's been a very, very high growth of hyperscaler revenue like over the past an acceleration for the hyper scalers in general. A lot of that is GPU related, but the growth we're seeing here and the exception we're seeing here is largely not GPU-related. It's a little bit of it, but not a ton of it. So that's not exactly what you've seen with some of the other vendors there. One reason this is broad-based is these are the same products we sell to all customers, and this is largely the same go-to-market organization that we have a few segments, but -- and we've been doing well executing there. I think we've invested quite a bit in product, and we keep and we will keep doing it, and we see the results of that.
David Obstler: Yes, I want to -- I'll add that it's across the customer base, enterprise SMB. And when we look at it, it's not just an AI SMB. If you remove the AI companies, you still see a strengthening SMB demand cycle going on. And unlike in previous periods, it also is across spending ranges. We're not seeing larger spenders or smaller spenders. We're just seeing a broad trend of improved demand across the spending trends.
Olivier Pomel: And remember that for us, SMB is, any company of less than 1,000 employees. It includes a lot of very legitimate and growing businesses. It's not...
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer & Co.
Ittai Kidron: Congrats guys. Really great numbers. Oli, in your answer to one of the questions and kind of going into the drivers behind the upside. You've talked about sales capacity increase. You didn't talk much about sales efficiency. Is there a way you can give us some color on where do you stand on percent of salespeople that are hitting quota, where does that ratio stand relative to historical patterns for you guys? And as you approach '26 year, do you anticipate any material changes in the comp structure just given the breadth of product and the list of opportunities, how do you get people focused?
Olivier Pomel: Yes. So we feel good about the sales productivity in general. And the rule generally, you grow by scaling capacity and maintaining productivity, it's hard to drive both up at the same time. And remember, if you want to go to 10x, you can do that by scaling if you can't really do it by improving productivity, so you have to scale. And we've been doing that, and we've been successful at it so far. In terms of the complaints that, look, we keep changing the way we compensate and the way we manage the sales force in general to make sure we have the right focus. One of the gifts of a business like ours is that we see -- we have a very heavy land-and-expand model. And so we get a lot of growth from existing customers. The challenge it creates on the other hand is how do we get to focus the sales force on the newer customers, the smaller ones and the new ones because it is more work to get an extra dollar for a smaller customer or for a new one and it is from an existing one that they already have scale. And so a lot of the tweaks we met to our comp plans relate to that. Who do we make sure we direct our attention and we reward people for what is going to generate the most long-term growth for us. And we've made a number of changes. I won't go through them, these are our internal changes. But we had a number of changes this year, we see a number of them pay off. Another thing I mentioned on the call was you mentioned a win for one of our new go-to-market motions and that specifically getting in place multiyear plans to go after some larger customers that are tougher to land than what we've done in the past. And sometimes, it takes more than a year to land certain types of customers. And the problem is if you comp plan only has a 1-year horizon, like it doesn't give a great incentive for the sales force to go after those customers. And so we cordoned off a few of those companies who have special plans to go after that, and we're starting to see success with that too. It's just an example.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Sherman of TD Cowen.
Andrew Sherman: Great. Congrats. I know you have a team focused on the Fortune 500, where there's still a lot of white space for you. Curious to hear how the team is ramping to productivity. Did that help drive some of the strong new logo bookings and can this contribute even more next year?
Olivier Pomel: Yes. I mean, look, the team is not new, right? I mean, we've been focusing on that for many years, and we're tracking well. One thing I was mentioning just before was one challenge even in the Fortune 500 is to make sure that we focus on landing new customers and make sure that there's the right amount of sales attention and reward for the landing a customer even if it's for a small amount, and I think we've done well. I mean again, we can comment on that again after the next quarter when we have a full year of our new clients that have been validated. But so far, we feel very good about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.
Aleksandr Zukin: Congrats on dropping some truly inspiring quotes in the script. Maybe Oli, one for you and then I have a quick follow-up for David. Just the duration of this acceleration of the non-AI cohort. It seems like from all your forward-looking metrics, whether it's billings, RPO, CRPO. Those were, again, really, really strong how long do you think we should think about the duration of this trend of this non-AI acceleration?
Olivier Pomel: Well, we're a consumption business. So we -- the hardest thing to understand is what the future is going to look like for consumption. The way I would say it is we feel very good about it at the midterm, long term. Now with ebbs and flow in any given month or quarter, that's harder to tell. And again, that's what we've seen through the life of the company. So we feel very confident about the motion in general for digital transformation and cloud migration is steady. And sometimes it slows down a little bit, but it reaccelerates after that. And we see that key going on for a very long time.
Aleksandr Zukin: Okay. And then maybe, David, for you, look, gross profit dollar acceleration while you're seeing your largest customer kind of get better unit economics is also inspiring to see how should we think about the progression of gross margins and gross profit dollar growth, particularly as you continue to also see the AI cohort acceleration.
David Obstler: Yes, there's a couple of things. I think we've mentioned that we've been focused and have focused over the many years on the efficiency of our cloud platform. We have significant engineering efforts around cost of sales and delivery of value. And so we've been able to deliver on that. We also have a very broad customer base distributed in terms of volume. So as customers get larger and maybe get volume discounts, we have a number -- a lot of customers coming in, it's smaller, so that balance there. And then in terms of the sort of the future -- I'll repeat what we've always said that we've been running the company with a gross margin plus or minus 80%, we've given that range and not changed it, and we watch it. And it gives us mixed signals in terms of efficiency, how we're operating, it gives us good signals in pricing and things like that and I wouldn't change the comments we made over the many years about looking at that and then developing operations and strategies around that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan MacWilliams of Wells Fargo.
Ryan MacWilliams: Just one for me. On the large AI contract expansion that you provided commentary on, is there any way we can think about the contribution change from this customer over the next few quarters?
David Obstler: No. I mean we don't provide that kind of information on individual customers. We're trying to give a picture of the overall business. Generally, I think as Oli mentioned, on our larger customers, we have a motion of the expansion of volume and then we talk when we work on the term and the volume-based pricing, but we don't give guidance like that on individual customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham.
Michael Cikos: I just wanted to come back to it, Oli, for the non-AI native strength, I know we've kind of hit on this a number of times, whether it's road map sales capacity execution, but like kudos on the numbers here? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the why now. Is it just a composite of all those different pieces clicking together this quarter? Or is there anything more to unpack there? And then I have a follow-up for David.
Olivier Pomel: Again, I don't think there's a lot more to unpack there. And I know it's boring in a way, but it's also the way we've been growing for the past 15 years, really. So that's a -- I would call it the usual.
Michael Cikos: Awesome. Awesome to hear. Okay. And then for the follow-up to David. David, I don't want to take anything away from the Q3 results you guys just posted, and we obviously have the strong guide here for Q4. But I just can imagine myself a month from now starting to get inbounds from certain folks asking about the holiday season and the fact that we have the holidays landing on weekdays in Q4 here. Can you just kind of discuss how you thought about constructing guidance for this Q4 year?
David Obstler: Yes. We have years of experience of analyzing the day-by-day patterns. In the holidays, we know that the holiday period ends up in the usage side because of vacation holidays, and we incorporate that into our guidance. We, I think, evolved a lot over the years and sort of days adjusted types of days, et cetera. And so we would be incorporating that like we've incorporated in other years. If there are differences in this calendar period, we incorporate that as always.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS.
Karl Keirstead: Okay. Great. I'll ask one for David and one for Olivier. David, first of all, congratulations on the extension of the larger contract, I think everybody on the line is applauding that. I know you're reticent to get into any details, but maybe I could try. Are you able to clarify whether that was a 1-year deal or multiyear? And then related to that, David, what is the contribution to CRPO from that deal, which I presume landed in your CRPO number. If it is a 1-year deal does the entirety of that contract contribute to the sequential CRPO performance in the quarter? So that's it for you, David. And then Olivier, maybe I'll just ask both at once. Some of the very large AI natives are beginning to diversify to utilizing Oracle's OCI and Stargate. And I'm wondering what's the opportunity for Datadog to essentially follow that behavior and begin scaling on Oracle's target or because a lot of what Oracle is doing with the AI native is training clusters, perhaps that near-term opportunity is more limited.
David Obstler: Yes. On the first point, I think we give a lot of examples and our motion, which our customers would be following, including that one would be -- we fix out annual plus commits. We're not commenting on individual contracts here, but it would follow a typical path to other types of contracts. So that's what we would do.
Olivier Pomel: Yes. And on the OCI, look, this is -- we've built an OCI integration, and then we see more demand from customers on OCI. Some of the things we see like the targets, et cetera, like these are extremely custom build out, like I don't know -- they're not necessarily exactly cloud because they are custom built for specific customers. So the opportunity there is more remote today. But it's -- again, one company is that it's a not fantastic opportunity to product type. But if 10, 15, 20, 50 companies start using that, then that really becomes a commercial opportunity. And so we're very much plugged into all of that. And we go basically where our customers are.
David Obstler: I think you mentioned about the RPO. I think in this case, we've mentioned this current and the total is roughly the same, and there wouldn't be anything in that contract that would have been materially around of those numbers. Those numbers, I think we mentioned are produced from the bookings growth more generally and not from that particular contract.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge of William Blair.
Jacob Roberge: Yes. Just on the recent go-to-market investments, obviously, it seems like there's been a lot of traction thus far with those. So I'm curious if there are any areas like security or the new logos or upmarket that you could look to lean even deeper into just given the growth that you've seen here.
Olivier Pomel: Yes, definitely. And there are some things we didn't do this year that we'll definitely go to the next year. So there's a number of things we are -- we're in Q4, right? So we're in the middle of planning for next year, and we basically will keep scaling what's working, stop doing some of the things that are not conclusive and then try to do more things. That's the way it works. Interestingly enough, building a go-to-market is not that different from building software like you experiment together data you see what's working was not working and you build the systems.
Jacob Roberge: That's helpful. And then just on the new Bits AI Agents, can you just talk about the early feedback that you've gotten for those solutions and maybe how the engagement with those agents as compared to kind of the ramp of security Flex Logs. I know, obviously, much earlier days, but just how it compared when those were still largely in the preview phase?
Olivier Pomel: I mean look, the Bits AI Agent is -- it really has a growth factor for customers. So what works really well is and we've seen that number of times, like we set it up for them. It's running on their alert and they go through an outage and they still go to the motion, so they still go -- they still set up a bridge and they have 20 people and they spend 2 hours and in the end, they have an idea what went wrong. And then they go to Datadog and they see, oh, there's an investigation that had run. And 3 minutes into the outage, it got the same conclusion that we got 2 hours later with 20 people on the call. And that's completely eye-opening for customers when they see us. And we have -- so that's why we get many quotes about it. So now there's more we need to do there, like customers say, "Oh, it's great. Now can it make this fix for me? Can you do this? Can you do that? Can you support that other system that right now, you can't actually set it up for. So we have a very, very full road map of things we need to do, and we're doubling down on it. We also shipped -- I mean this one is in preview, but we shipped a security agent that looks at vulnerabilities and looks at security signals and those triad that basically look at trying to investigate what might be benign or what might be a real issue. We also are getting very, very positive feedback for that. And in fact, that's what helped us win some large land deals for our Cloud SIEM products because the combination of the SIEM that runs extremely efficiently on top of observability data that runs very efficiently on top of Flex Log, but also saves an immense amount of time by getting 90% of the issues out of the way with automated investigation that's extremely attractive to customers. All right. And I think with that, we're going to close the call. So -- before we go, I just want to give one quick shout out to the team because I know, as I said earlier, we have quite a lot going on in Q4, whether it's on the planning side, on the product building side or on the sales side, where I said we have a really, really exciting pipeline. And so we have a lot to do. I want to thank the team for the hard work there. I also -- I'm looking forward to meeting a lot of our existing and new customers at AWS re:Invent in a few weeks, and I'll see you all there. Thank you all.
Operator: Thank you for your participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2025 Datadog Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Yuka Broderick, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Yuka Broderick: Thank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to review Datadog's third quarter 2025 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued this morning. Joining me on the call today are Olivier Pomel, Datadog's Co-Founder and CEO; and David Obstler, Datadog's CFO.

The words anticipate, believe, continue, estimate, expect, intend, will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements or similar indications of future expectations. These statements reflect our views only as of today and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025. Additional information will be made available in our upcoming Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2025, and other filings with the SEC. This information is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website, along with a replay of this call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables in our earnings release, which is available at investors.datadoghq.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Olivier.
Olivier Pomel: Thanks, Yuka, and thank all of you for joining us this morning to go through our results for Q3. Let me begin with this quarter's business drivers. We have seen broad-based positive trends in the demand environment with an ongoing strength of cloud migration and digital transformation. Against this backdrop, we executed a very strong Q3 both in new logo bookings and usage growth of existing customers. As a notable inflection, we saw acceleration of year-over-year revenue growth across our non AI customers. And the sequential usage growth for non-AI existing customers was the highest we have seen going back 12 quarters. This growth was broad-based as our customers are adopting more products and getting more value from the Datadog platform. We also experienced strong revenue growth for our AI native customers and a broadening contribution to growth among those customers. There, too, we saw an acceleration of growth in our AI cohort in Q3 when excluding our largest customer. Looking at new business. Contribution from new customers increased in Q3 in both the amount of new customer bookings as well as the revenue contribution from new customers. And as usual, churn has remained low with gross revenue retention stable in the mid- to high 90s, highlighting the mission-critical nature of our platform for our customers. Regarding our Q3 financial performance and key metrics. Revenue was $886 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance range. We ended Q3 with about 32,000 customers up from about 29,200 a year ago. We also ended with about 4,060 customers with an ARR of $100,000 more, up from about 3,490 a year ago. These customers generated about 89% of our ARR. And we generated free cash flow of $214 million with a free cash flow margin of 24%. Turning to customer adoption. Our platform strategy continues to resonate in the market. At the end of Q3, 84% of customers were using 2 or more products, up from 83% a year ago. 54% of customers were using 4 or more products, up from 49% a year ago. 31% of our customers were using 6 or more products, up from 26% a year ago and 16% of our customers were using 8 or products, up from 12% a year ago. Digital experience is an example of an area within our platform where our rapid piece of innovation is turning into tangible value for our customers. Our digital experience products include RUM or Real User Monitoring, to observe and improve application behavior in mobile and web apps, synthetics to stimulate user flows and proactively detect user facing issues and product analytics to help users connect application behavior to business impact. Over the years, we built our product breadth and depth in this area, and that is being recognized in the marketplace. For the second year in a row, Datadog has been named the leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Monitoring. We are pleased that today, these digital experience products together exceed $300 million in ARR. And this includes, in particular, a very fast ramp for product analytics, which has already seen adoption by more than 1,000 customers. We also want to call out our security suite of products where we are executing and accelerating growth. Security ARR growth was in the mid-50s as a percentage year-over-year in Q3, up from the mid-40s we mentioned last quarter. We're starting to see success in including Cloud SIEM in larger deals, and we'll get back to that in a bit in our customer examples. And we're seeing positive trends beyond Cloud SIEM, including fast uptake of good security and an increasing number of wins in cloud security. Overall, we saw year-over-year growth acceleration in each one of our security products. Moving on to R&D. We continue to deliver on what is a very ambitious AI road map. We are seeing high customer interest in our Bits AI agents, which we announced at our DASH user conference in June. We have now onboarded thousands of customers for preview access, the Bits AI SRE agent. And as we prepare for general availability, we are getting very enthusiastic feedback on the time and cost savings enabled by Bits AI. As RUM user recently told us, with Bits AI SRE being on call 24/7 for us, meantime to resolution for our services has improved significantly. For most cases, the investigation is already taken care of well before our engineers sit down and open their laptops to assess the issue. And this is not an isolated comment. We see the potential here for our agents who radically transform observability and operations. In LLM observability, we recently launched LLM experiments and playgrounds for general availability, helping teams to rapidly iterate on LLM applications and AI agents. We also launched custom LLM as a judge evaluations for general availability, which lets customers write evaluation prompts to access application quality and safety. As an illustration of growth and adoption in the past few months, the number of LLM spans customers are sending to Datadog has more than quadrupled. And we are seeing a lot of interest in the Datadog MCP servers. Our MCP server acts as a bridge between Datadog and AI agents, such as Codex OpenAI, Claude by Anthropic, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Goose by Block and many more. Our preview customers are using real-time production data context to drive trouble shooting, root causes analysis and automation in these agents. One user told us, the Datadog MCP server is a great tool. It enables me to get the last 5 of my app and follow the spans and traces all the way to the root cause. I have never been more hooked on Datadog. So we see MCP adoption as a great way to cement Datadog even further into our customers' workflows. Finally, we continue to see rising customer interest for next-gen AI observability with over 5,000 customers sending us AI data to one or more of AI integrations. On the topic of integrations, we are very proud to now support over 1,000 integrations, which we believe is unparalleled in our space. By using our integrations, customer call it otherwise disparate data sources across Datadog products for deeper analysis. We can see from a customers usage that this is a critical part of the Datadog platform. Our 32,000 customers use more than 50 integrations on average, while customers spending over $1 million annually with us use more than 150. And most importantly, as tech stack evolves, we continue to update and expand our integrations. So our customers can use Datadog to deploy new technologies with confidence. Last but not least, I wanted to give a shout out to our AI research team for the amazing work they have published. Our TOTO OpenWave time-series forecasting model has been one of the top downloads on Hugging Face over the past few months, and that is across all categories. It is very impactful as, among other things, the high quality of this work allows us to attract world-class AI researchers and engineers. Now let's move on to sales and marketing. We had a number of great new logo wins in customer expansion this quarter. So I'll go through a few of them. First, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a leading European telco, our largest ever land deal in Europe. This company's previous setup was expensive, inefficient and wasn't scaling to meet their needs. By using Datadog, they expect to save over $1 million annually on tool cost alone, along with millions of dollars more in reduced operation costs, lower engineering time and avoidance of revenue loss. They will adopt 11 Datadog products to start, and we consolidate more than 10 commercial and open source tools. Next, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a leading financial risk and analytics company. The company's fragmented tooling has led to major incidents that sometimes took multiple days and hundreds of engineers to resolve. They plan to start with 11 Datadog products including On-Call, Cloud SIEM and Bits AI, and will replace 14 commercial open source and hyperscale observability tools. Next, we landed a 7-figure annualized deal with a Fortune 500 technology hardware company. This is an exciting win for new -- sorry. This is an exciting win for our new go-to-market motions, targeting the largest and most sophisticated companies in the world. Datadog has been chosen as their strategic observability partner, and we are displacing commercial tools across availability, cloud team and incident response. This customer is starting with 14 Datadog products. Next, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 500 financial services company. This customer has pockets of siloed teams and data, including one business unit, which manually hosted and maintained 93 separate instances of open source tooling. With this expansion, this company will adopt 15 Datadog products, including all 3 pillars in all of their business units. They will also replace their SIEM solution with Datadog Cloud SIEM in a 7-figure land deal for Cloud SIEM. And by bringing all their telemetry data into the Datadog platform, they expect better insights for their adoption of Bits AI SRE Agents today and Bits AI [indiscernible]. Next, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a Fortune 500 heavy equipment company. With this expansion, this customer will replace its open source log solution with Datadog log management and Flex logs. They plan to adopt LLM Observability and their IT team is using cloud cost management to improve cost visibility and governance. Next, we will come back a leading vertical SaaS company with a 7-figure analyze deal. By returning to Datadog, this customer benefits from our alignment with open telemetry and we'll implement the incident and reliability processes that they were unable to execute on previously. Next, we signed a 7-figure annualized expansion with a major American carmaker. This customer is adopting Datadog products faster than previously expected and this agreement supports the higher usage. With this expansion, they will adopt Datadog incident management and On-Call solution company-wide for a total of 5,000 users who support operational continuity across the business. Finally, we signed a 9-figure annualized expansion with a leading AI company. This company has been a long-time Datadog customer and has expanded their usage of multiple products, securing better economics for a higher commitment with an early renewal. Speaking of AI customers, we continue to help AI native customers big and small to grow and scale their businesses. And we continue to see this group broaden in number and size with more than 500 AI native companies in this group, but 100 of which are spending more than $100,000 annually with Datadog and more than 15 who are spending more than $1 million annually with us. While we know there's a lot of attention on this cohort, we primarily see it as an indication of what's to come as companies of every size and every single industry incorporate AI into their cloud applications. And that's it for another very strong quarter from our go-to-market teams, who are now very hard at work as we have a really exciting pipeline for Q4. Before I turn it over to David for a financial review, I want to say a few words on our longer-term outlook. There is no change to our overall view that digital transformation and cloud migration are long-term secular growth drivers of our business. Meanwhile, we are advancing rapidly in AI, where we are incredibly excited about our opportunities. We're building a comprehensive set of AI Observability products to help our customers tackle the higher complexity that comes with these technologies. And we are building AI into Datadog, and I spoke earlier about the excitement our customers have for our Bits AI agents. The market opportunity in cloud and AI is expected to grow rapidly into the trillions of dollars and companies of every size and industry are looking to adopt AI to deliver value to their customers and drive positive business outcome. So we're moving fast to help our customers develop, deploy and grow into the cloud and into the AI world. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO. David?
David Obstler: Thanks, Olivier. To start, our Q3 revenue was $886 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. To dive into some of the drivers of our Q3 revenue growth. First, overall, we saw sequential usage growth from existing customers in Q3 that was higher than our expectations and the strongest in 12 quarters in our non-AI native customer base. We saw year-over-year growth acceleration broadly across our business, including in new logos and existing customers, both enterprise and SMB, with customers across our spending bands, big and small, and customers in a wide variety of industries. Next, we saw strong and accelerating contribution from new customers. New logo annualized bookings more than doubled year-over-year and set a new record driven by an increase in average new logo land size, particularly in enterprise. We believe we are starting to see the benefits of our growth of sales capacity. And we are seeing new logos ramping faster, contributing more to revenue growth. The portion of our year-over-year revenue growth that related to new customers was about 25% in Q3, up from 20% in Q2. Next, our AI native customers continue to exhibit rapid growth, while more customers in this group are growing to be sizable customers. As Olivier discussed, we extended the contract of our largest AI native customer. In addition, we now have more larger AI customers, including 15 of them spending $1 million or more annually with Datadog, and about 100 spending more than $100,000 annually. Year-over-year revenue growth from our AI native customers, excluding the largest customer, again, accelerated in Q3. In Q3, this group represented 12% of our revenue, up from 11% last quarter and about 6% in the year ago quarter. I will note that over time, we think this metric will become less relevant as AI usage in production broadens beyond this group of customers. Our year-over-year revenue growth also accelerated amongst our non-AI native customers. In Q3, our revenue growth, excluding the AI native customer group, was 20% year-over-year, accelerating from 18% year-over-year in Q2, and we have seen this trend of accelerating growth continue in October. Regarding retention metrics. Our trailing 12-month net revenue retention percentage was 120% similar to last quarter and our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention percentage remain in the mid- to high 90s. And now moving on to our financial results. Our billings were $893 million, up 30% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO was $2.79 billion, up 53% year-over-year, and current RPO growth was in the low 50s percentage year-over-year. Our strong bookings contributed to this acceleration of RPO. We continue to believe that revenue is a better indication of our trends in our business than billings and RPO. And now let's review some of the key income statement results. Unless otherwise noted, all metrics are non-GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financials in our earnings release. First, gross profit in the quarter was $719 million, and our gross margin was 81.2%. This compares to a gross margin of 80.9% last quarter and 81.1% in the year ago quarter. As previously mentioned, we continue to see the impact of our engineers cost-saving efforts in Q3 as they deliver on our cloud efficiency project. Our Q3 OpEx grew 30% -- 32% excuse me, year-over-year, down from 36% last quarter. We continue to grow our investments to pursue our long-term growth opportunities, and this OpEx growth is an indication of our execution on our hiring plan. Q3 operating income was $207 million for a 23% operating margin compared to 20% last quarter and 25% in the year ago quarter. And now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash flow from operations was $251 billion in the quarter. After taking into consideration capital expenditures and capitalized software, free cash flow was $214 million for a free cash flow margin of 24%. And now for our outlook for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2025. First, our guidance velocity overall remains unchanged. As a reminder, we based our guidance on trends observed in recent months and imply conservatism on these growth trends. So for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $912 million to $916 million, which represents a 24% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $216 million to $220 million, which implies an operating margin of 24%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56 per share based on approximately 367 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. And for the full year -- fiscal year 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $3.386 billion to $3.390 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $754 million to $758 million, which implies an operating margin of 22%. And non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $2 to $2.02 per share, based on 364 million weighted average diluted shares. And finally, some additional notes on our guidance. We expect net interest and other income for the fiscal year 2025 to be approximately $170 million. We continue to expect cash taxes in 2025 to be about $10 million to $20 million and we continue to apply a 21% non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 and going forward. And finally, we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 4% of revenues in fiscal year 2025. To summarize, we are pleased with our execution in Q3. We are well positioned to help our existing and prospective customers with their cloud migration and digital transformation journeys, including their adoption of AI. And I want to thank Datadog's worldwide for their efforts. And with that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs.
Kasthuri Rangan: Appreciate it. Congratulations on the spectacular results and showing sequential improvement across the board. Olivier, I had a question for you. We've talked about GPU monetization versus CPU monetization. So how closer are we to the point where you can confidently expand and get your share of the customer wallet when it comes to whether it's training workload, inferencing workload on the GPU clusters, which are becoming more prevalent and increasingly a larger part of the compute build-out in the future? That's it for me.
Olivier Pomel: Yes. So we have products that are getting into the market now for GPU monitoring. But these don't generate any significant revenue yet. So all the revenues we've shared, like the acceleration, et cetera, that's not related to us capitalizing more on GPUs, that's a future opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley.
Sanjit Singh: Congrats on the acceleration in growth this quarter. Olivier, I wanted to talk about some of those enterprise trends you're seeing in sort of your non-AI cohort. What do you sort of put the improved performance in growth this quarter on? You mentioned that the sales productivity or the benefit from some of the sales investments starting to come online. Is there sort of an uplift in sort of the cloud migration trends as you're starting to see enterprise build more AI applications. I'd just love to get your perspective on the underlying trends in the enterprise and the mid-market business.
Olivier Pomel: Yes. I'd say there's 3 parts to it. One part is the demand environment is not -- is positive in general. I don't know that we see massive acceleration of cloud migration, but at least the environment is not pushing the other way. We know which happens from time to time. So that's point number one. Point number two is we've been growing sales capacity quite a bit, and we've created new go-to-market motions to go after the kind of customers who were not getting before. Like we've done quite a bit of investment over the past couple of years and we see that starting to pay off. As I said also, we feel good about Q4 in terms of pipeline on the sales side. So it's too early to tell yet. We still have to close those deals, but we feel good about the scaling of our go-to-market. And point number three is we have a number of products that we've been developing over the years. Some of them are early, some of them a little bit further along that are really clicking. We see -- we have a lot of success with getting large enterprises to adopt Flex Logs, for example. We have a lot of success in some of new products such as analytics that we mentioned on the call. We're seeing some large land deals with our cloud team. So all of that is contributing to the picture you're seeing today.
Sanjit Singh: And just as a follow-up on the AI observability opportunity. When you look at some of the independent software vendors that are releasing Agentic solutions, Agentic portfolios. A number of them are including observability as part of their sort of value proposition. Is there any work you think Datadog has to do to sort of infiltrate that market or make sure that customers look to Datadog as that Agentic monitoring capability as some of these independent software vendors try to bundle in observability into their solutions. I would love to get your perspective on that?
Olivier Pomel: Yes. I mean there's absolutely no doubt to us that the customers will even want a unified platform for observability for all of this. There's 2 parts to that. One is, historically, every single piece of software we integrate with, whether that's SaaS or things that customers on themselves, also has its own management control and observability control. But you're not going to log into [ 70 ] or in the case of customers we mentioned that they use 60 integrations for the smaller customers, 150 integrations for the larger ones. It's not practical to actually go and manage that separately. So we think all of that belongs in a central place, and that's the historical trend we've seen. We also think that you can't separate the AI parts from the non-AI parts of the business. So you're not going to look at your agents separately that you do at your web hosting and your database and your -- everything else you have in your stack. So all of that in the end will be attached to observability.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.
Raimo Lenschow: Perfect. Congrats from me as well. That sounded like an amazing quarter and nice to see it coming together. On the AI side, and I don't want to talk about the customer, but more the other ones, like 15 customers over 1 million. That's like a big number and 100 over 100,000. How do we have to think about the nature of those? Is this kind of -- are those kind of especially the bigger ones of those kind of model builders, but then even 15 is a big number. And over 100 sounds like this whole new application world that we've all been kind of waiting for starting to come together. Is that kind of what's going on there? Because it does sound quite exciting and much more broader than we thought.
Olivier Pomel: It's actually fairly broad. So there is model vendors, there's models -- model that can be the lens model that can be video, it can be sound generation, it can be all of the various parts of the stack you see as independent companies. It can be -- there's quite a few companies that do that work on the coding side. So coding assistants and vibe coders and everything in that range. Some of these are very new companies. Some of these are not very new companies, some of these started 5, 7, 8 years ago. And we're sort of not necessarily AI native from day 1, but very quickly, that would give them the growth they see today with the people to AI. So we see a little bit of that. We have companies that are other parts of the stack in AI on the, say, the [ steady ] side, the other components of the infrastructure. And we have other companies that are purely applications filled with AI. So we have a bit of everything in there. Like it's actually fairly representative of the space.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy of JPMorgan.
Mark Murphy: You had mentioned the expansion of the contract with your largest AI native customer and I believe you said better economics for a higher commitment. Can you speak to that because I would assume a higher commitment would carry a volume-based discount. I'm just trying to understand if. For some reason, if that was not the case here, what did you mean by better economics? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Olivier Pomel: Yes. I mean, this is without getting to the detail of any specific customer like this is the motion is always the same, like customers grow, they commit to more, they get better prices. So you see, like a, again, talking about customers in general, you see both of usage, drops in revenue as customers renew and get higher commit and a better price and then usually growth after that for those customers. That's the motion that we've had. We have about 30,000 customers so far.
Mark Murphy: Okay. And the -- what in that, so the better economics part of it is just where it's going to be netting out like 12 months down the road? Is that what you mean?
Olivier Pomel: Well, the bigger economics means you commit tomorrow, you get a better price. And as we -- remember, we have a usage model. So we charge people every month on what they use at the price we agreed. So if you get better economics, and your usage is somewhat similar month to month, one month and the next that you pay less, but the overall backdrop of our business is increased consumption.
Mark Murphy: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, Olivier, the acceleration that you saw in the security growth is pretty noticeable too. We recall, I think about 6 months ago, you had ramped up and engaged a lot more of a channel partners, which is a key ingredient to grow in the security business. Is it a function of that? Or is there a mindset change happening out there where customers want observability to be the central point of collection so that all the security teams and the ops teams are working with the same set of metrics and logs and tracers?
Olivier Pomel: Look, I think it's a number of things. Definitely, we've been investing in the channel, and that's certainly helpful to do the security business as a whole. The win -- the big win we mentioned on security that we mentioned a couple of wins in Cloud SIEM. These tends to be more related to product maturity. The strength of our underlying platform, especially when it comes to technology like Flex Logs, for example. And the fact also that we've been learning how to properly go to market for security. And I think we see things clicking in a way that is exciting.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi.
Fatima Boolani: Oli, I'll start with you and I have a follow-up for Dave. On the On-Call product, Oli, how do agentic advancements in general detract or enhance the value proposition here? And I'm very simplistically thinking about the core nature and value proposition of the On-Call product intelligently routing, requests for remediation, right? So how do you just broader advancements in AI, help beef up and/or detract your ability to monetize this product? And then just a follow-up for David, please.
Olivier Pomel: Well, I mean, if you zoom out, we entered the field with On-Call because we wanted to own the end-to-end incident resolution. So we wanted because we before that, we were detecting the incidents and sending the alerts, and then we were pretty much where the resolution happened after that. Customers were spending their time in data to diagnose and understand what was going on. So we wanted to own the full cycle. . And we thought that with AI, in particular, we'd have the ability to do things if we are on the whole cycle that we couldn't do otherwise. So what you see right now is, I mean, this resonates with customers, they adopting to product. We've mentioned like some exciting customers with say, [ one ] with 5,000 seats for On-Call, which is very exciting. But in the future, there's many more things we can do in working on for that product. If we both detect incident and notify, we can do some sort of things such as even predicting the incident and notifying early or rerouting early or telling people before the incident actually takes place, how they can potentially fix it. So these are all things we're working on. I mean, look, if you look at the various product announcements we've made, whether that's Bits AI or SRE or the time series forecasting model we have released. When you assemble all that, you get to a very, very interesting picture of what we can do in the future. So we're excited by that. Our customers are excited by the vision there too, and that's why these products are successful.
Fatima Boolani: Appreciate that. David, on net retention rates, why aren't we necessarily seeing more upward pressure on the metric, just given the strength of expansionary bookings that you alluded to in the quarter from the installed base. And I mean I suspect it's because it's a trailing 12-month metric. But any directional color you can just share on that. And any high-level commentary on some of the non-AI native net retention rate trend behavior?
David Obstler: Yes, you've nailed it. It's a trailing 12 months, it's a number that's rounded, it has the dynamics that you might expect in that the growth of the non-AI natives has been, as we mentioned, a combination of landing and expanding at higher rates than we've seen in recent quarters. So if that continues as you go into a trailing 12-month metric, you see a directional movement.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Heath of KeyBanc.
Eric Heath: Oli, David, Bits AI seems like a really exciting thing out of Dash. And I know it's still in preview, but you mentioned there's a lot of interest there. So I'm just curious how you think about the agentic opportunity with Bits AI. How meaningful this can be for 2026 as a differentiator versus competition and also as a revenue contributor?
Olivier Pomel: Yes. So -- I mean, look, it's super exciting. The feedback is very good on it. I mean, we've been collecting all the -- so I read one quote, we have dozens that look just like that, that was sent to us by customers. And so that's very, very exciting. We also started having some customers buy and come to it to just to show value and to make sure we're on to the right product mix. And so we feel good that this is something that is high quality and we can monetize. In terms of the impact for next year, on the packaging side, I'm not completely sure yet whether the biggest impact will be seen from what we charge Bits AI itself or for the rest of the platform, that it gets benefits from the differentiation of Bits AI. I think that's more of a broader question of packaging and monetization of AI. And remember that we have a product that is usage based. So anything that drives usage up and adoption from customers is good for us and is very, very monetizable. But what we can tell is this is differentiating, this is good. It works significantly better than anything else we've seen or heard of in the market, and we are doubling down on it. We have many, many teams now working on deepening Bits AI SREs to making sure it goes further into the resolution doesn't just point to the issue, but fixes the code that all these kind of things working hard on that. We're also working on breadth, making sure that we train it on many more types of data, many types of sources, sometimes even systems that are observe the systems that are not dialed up, so we can cut across to other systems our customers are using. So we are very, very aggressively developing Bits AI SRE. It's resonating very well in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gray Powell of BTIG.
Gray Powell: Congratulations on the great results. So maybe just like taking a step back, if we go back to the beginning of the year, Datadog was expecting 19% revenue growth. It looks like you're tracking to something over 26% growth now, and that's just the high end of your guidance. So I guess my question is, what surprised you the most this year? And then just how do you feel about the sustainability of those drivers as you look forward?
Olivier Pomel: I mean, look, the -- so first, I apologize for over delivering on the results. We might do it again, but we'll see. I think the biggest surprise for us has been that -- so AI in general has or AI adoption has grown faster than we thought it would at the beginning of the year. So we've seen that across our AI cohort. We've seen also that we got some of our new products and new, like the changes we're making on the go-to-market side to click perhaps earlier than we would have thought otherwise. So all in all, we saw the leading part of the business with AI growth faster, not the lagging but the slower growing, more traditional part of the business also accelerate and that gets us where we are today.
David Obstler: And I'd add, we have a good demand environment and we've been investing whether it be in the products that Oli's been talking about or in the sales capacity we made clear that we were in investment and we're seeing those investments pay off.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda of Bank of America Securities.
Koji Ikeda: Just one from me here. I wanted to ask a question on the inflection in the non-AI native growth and how to think about the areas of strength in this cohort. Is it coming from your largest enterprises? Is it coming from a certain type of customer? Is there a common theme in the workloads that you're seeing or the products that are being added on that is driving that strength? Or is it just really just broad-based? What I'm trying to get out here is I'm really trying to understand more the durability of this growth reflection.
Olivier Pomel: So it is broad-based. And I think, again, speaks to a couple of things. It speaks to the fact that, in general, the demand environment is good. Though I would say, there's been a very, very high growth of hyperscaler revenue like over the past an acceleration for the hyper scalers in general. A lot of that is GPU related, but the growth we're seeing here and the exception we're seeing here is largely not GPU-related. It's a little bit of it, but not a ton of it. So that's not exactly what you've seen with some of the other vendors there. One reason this is broad-based is these are the same products we sell to all customers, and this is largely the same go-to-market organization that we have a few segments, but -- and we've been doing well executing there. I think we've invested quite a bit in product, and we keep and we will keep doing it, and we see the results of that.
David Obstler: Yes, I want to -- I'll add that it's across the customer base, enterprise SMB. And when we look at it, it's not just an AI SMB. If you remove the AI companies, you still see a strengthening SMB demand cycle going on. And unlike in previous periods, it also is across spending ranges. We're not seeing larger spenders or smaller spenders. We're just seeing a broad trend of improved demand across the spending trends.
Olivier Pomel: And remember that for us, SMB is, any company of less than 1,000 employees. It includes a lot of very legitimate and growing businesses. It's not...
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer & Co.
Ittai Kidron: Congrats guys. Really great numbers. Oli, in your answer to one of the questions and kind of going into the drivers behind the upside. You've talked about sales capacity increase. You didn't talk much about sales efficiency. Is there a way you can give us some color on where do you stand on percent of salespeople that are hitting quota, where does that ratio stand relative to historical patterns for you guys? And as you approach '26 year, do you anticipate any material changes in the comp structure just given the breadth of product and the list of opportunities, how do you get people focused?
Olivier Pomel: Yes. So we feel good about the sales productivity in general. And the rule generally, you grow by scaling capacity and maintaining productivity, it's hard to drive both up at the same time. And remember, if you want to go to 10x, you can do that by scaling if you can't really do it by improving productivity, so you have to scale. And we've been doing that, and we've been successful at it so far. In terms of the complaints that, look, we keep changing the way we compensate and the way we manage the sales force in general to make sure we have the right focus. One of the gifts of a business like ours is that we see -- we have a very heavy land-and-expand model. And so we get a lot of growth from existing customers. The challenge it creates on the other hand is how do we get to focus the sales force on the newer customers, the smaller ones and the new ones because it is more work to get an extra dollar for a smaller customer or for a new one and it is from an existing one that they already have scale. And so a lot of the tweaks we met to our comp plans relate to that. Who do we make sure we direct our attention and we reward people for what is going to generate the most long-term growth for us. And we've made a number of changes. I won't go through them, these are our internal changes. But we had a number of changes this year, we see a number of them pay off. Another thing I mentioned on the call was you mentioned a win for one of our new go-to-market motions and that specifically getting in place multiyear plans to go after some larger customers that are tougher to land than what we've done in the past. And sometimes, it takes more than a year to land certain types of customers. And the problem is if you comp plan only has a 1-year horizon, like it doesn't give a great incentive for the sales force to go after those customers. And so we cordoned off a few of those companies who have special plans to go after that, and we're starting to see success with that too. It's just an example.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Sherman of TD Cowen.
Andrew Sherman: Great. Congrats. I know you have a team focused on the Fortune 500, where there's still a lot of white space for you. Curious to hear how the team is ramping to productivity. Did that help drive some of the strong new logo bookings and can this contribute even more next year?
Olivier Pomel: Yes. I mean, look, the team is not new, right? I mean, we've been focusing on that for many years, and we're tracking well. One thing I was mentioning just before was one challenge even in the Fortune 500 is to make sure that we focus on landing new customers and make sure that there's the right amount of sales attention and reward for the landing a customer even if it's for a small amount, and I think we've done well. I mean again, we can comment on that again after the next quarter when we have a full year of our new clients that have been validated. But so far, we feel very good about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.
Aleksandr Zukin: Congrats on dropping some truly inspiring quotes in the script. Maybe Oli, one for you and then I have a quick follow-up for David. Just the duration of this acceleration of the non-AI cohort. It seems like from all your forward-looking metrics, whether it's billings, RPO, CRPO. Those were, again, really, really strong how long do you think we should think about the duration of this trend of this non-AI acceleration?
Olivier Pomel: Well, we're a consumption business. So we -- the hardest thing to understand is what the future is going to look like for consumption. The way I would say it is we feel very good about it at the midterm, long term. Now with ebbs and flow in any given month or quarter, that's harder to tell. And again, that's what we've seen through the life of the company. So we feel very confident about the motion in general for digital transformation and cloud migration is steady. And sometimes it slows down a little bit, but it reaccelerates after that. And we see that key going on for a very long time.
Aleksandr Zukin: Okay. And then maybe, David, for you, look, gross profit dollar acceleration while you're seeing your largest customer kind of get better unit economics is also inspiring to see how should we think about the progression of gross margins and gross profit dollar growth, particularly as you continue to also see the AI cohort acceleration.
David Obstler: Yes, there's a couple of things. I think we've mentioned that we've been focused and have focused over the many years on the efficiency of our cloud platform. We have significant engineering efforts around cost of sales and delivery of value. And so we've been able to deliver on that. We also have a very broad customer base distributed in terms of volume. So as customers get larger and maybe get volume discounts, we have a number -- a lot of customers coming in, it's smaller, so that balance there. And then in terms of the sort of the future -- I'll repeat what we've always said that we've been running the company with a gross margin plus or minus 80%, we've given that range and not changed it, and we watch it. And it gives us mixed signals in terms of efficiency, how we're operating, it gives us good signals in pricing and things like that and I wouldn't change the comments we made over the many years about looking at that and then developing operations and strategies around that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan MacWilliams of Wells Fargo.
Ryan MacWilliams: Just one for me. On the large AI contract expansion that you provided commentary on, is there any way we can think about the contribution change from this customer over the next few quarters?
David Obstler: No. I mean we don't provide that kind of information on individual customers. We're trying to give a picture of the overall business. Generally, I think as Oli mentioned, on our larger customers, we have a motion of the expansion of volume and then we talk when we work on the term and the volume-based pricing, but we don't give guidance like that on individual customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham.
Michael Cikos: I just wanted to come back to it, Oli, for the non-AI native strength, I know we've kind of hit on this a number of times, whether it's road map sales capacity execution, but like kudos on the numbers here? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the why now. Is it just a composite of all those different pieces clicking together this quarter? Or is there anything more to unpack there? And then I have a follow-up for David.
Olivier Pomel: Again, I don't think there's a lot more to unpack there. And I know it's boring in a way, but it's also the way we've been growing for the past 15 years, really. So that's a -- I would call it the usual.
Michael Cikos: Awesome. Awesome to hear. Okay. And then for the follow-up to David. David, I don't want to take anything away from the Q3 results you guys just posted, and we obviously have the strong guide here for Q4. But I just can imagine myself a month from now starting to get inbounds from certain folks asking about the holiday season and the fact that we have the holidays landing on weekdays in Q4 here. Can you just kind of discuss how you thought about constructing guidance for this Q4 year?
David Obstler: Yes. We have years of experience of analyzing the day-by-day patterns. In the holidays, we know that the holiday period ends up in the usage side because of vacation holidays, and we incorporate that into our guidance. We, I think, evolved a lot over the years and sort of days adjusted types of days, et cetera. And so we would be incorporating that like we've incorporated in other years. If there are differences in this calendar period, we incorporate that as always.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS.
Karl Keirstead: Okay. Great. I'll ask one for David and one for Olivier. David, first of all, congratulations on the extension of the larger contract, I think everybody on the line is applauding that. I know you're reticent to get into any details, but maybe I could try. Are you able to clarify whether that was a 1-year deal or multiyear? And then related to that, David, what is the contribution to CRPO from that deal, which I presume landed in your CRPO number. If it is a 1-year deal does the entirety of that contract contribute to the sequential CRPO performance in the quarter? So that's it for you, David. And then Olivier, maybe I'll just ask both at once. Some of the very large AI natives are beginning to diversify to utilizing Oracle's OCI and Stargate. And I'm wondering what's the opportunity for Datadog to essentially follow that behavior and begin scaling on Oracle's target or because a lot of what Oracle is doing with the AI native is training clusters, perhaps that near-term opportunity is more limited.
David Obstler: Yes. On the first point, I think we give a lot of examples and our motion, which our customers would be following, including that one would be -- we fix out annual plus commits. We're not commenting on individual contracts here, but it would follow a typical path to other types of contracts. So that's what we would do.
Olivier Pomel: Yes. And on the OCI, look, this is -- we've built an OCI integration, and then we see more demand from customers on OCI. Some of the things we see like the targets, et cetera, like these are extremely custom build out, like I don't know -- they're not necessarily exactly cloud because they are custom built for specific customers. So the opportunity there is more remote today. But it's -- again, one company is that it's a not fantastic opportunity to product type. But if 10, 15, 20, 50 companies start using that, then that really becomes a commercial opportunity. And so we're very much plugged into all of that. And we go basically where our customers are.
David Obstler: I think you mentioned about the RPO. I think in this case, we've mentioned this current and the total is roughly the same, and there wouldn't be anything in that contract that would have been materially around of those numbers. Those numbers, I think we mentioned are produced from the bookings growth more generally and not from that particular contract.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge of William Blair.
Jacob Roberge: Yes. Just on the recent go-to-market investments, obviously, it seems like there's been a lot of traction thus far with those. So I'm curious if there are any areas like security or the new logos or upmarket that you could look to lean even deeper into just given the growth that you've seen here.
Olivier Pomel: Yes, definitely. And there are some things we didn't do this year that we'll definitely go to the next year. So there's a number of things we are -- we're in Q4, right? So we're in the middle of planning for next year, and we basically will keep scaling what's working, stop doing some of the things that are not conclusive and then try to do more things. That's the way it works. Interestingly enough, building a go-to-market is not that different from building software like you experiment together data you see what's working was not working and you build the systems.
Jacob Roberge: That's helpful. And then just on the new Bits AI Agents, can you just talk about the early feedback that you've gotten for those solutions and maybe how the engagement with those agents as compared to kind of the ramp of security Flex Logs. I know, obviously, much earlier days, but just how it compared when those were still largely in the preview phase?
Olivier Pomel: I mean look, the Bits AI Agent is -- it really has a growth factor for customers. So what works really well is and we've seen that number of times, like we set it up for them. It's running on their alert and they go through an outage and they still go to the motion, so they still go -- they still set up a bridge and they have 20 people and they spend 2 hours and in the end, they have an idea what went wrong. And then they go to Datadog and they see, oh, there's an investigation that had run. And 3 minutes into the outage, it got the same conclusion that we got 2 hours later with 20 people on the call. And that's completely eye-opening for customers when they see us. And we have -- so that's why we get many quotes about it. So now there's more we need to do there, like customers say, "Oh, it's great. Now can it make this fix for me? Can you do this? Can you do that? Can you support that other system that right now, you can't actually set it up for. So we have a very, very full road map of things we need to do, and we're doubling down on it. We also shipped -- I mean this one is in preview, but we shipped a security agent that looks at vulnerabilities and looks at security signals and those triad that basically look at trying to investigate what might be benign or what might be a real issue. We also are getting very, very positive feedback for that. And in fact, that's what helped us win some large land deals for our Cloud SIEM products because the combination of the SIEM that runs extremely efficiently on top of observability data that runs very efficiently on top of Flex Log, but also saves an immense amount of time by getting 90% of the issues out of the way with automated investigation that's extremely attractive to customers. All right. And I think with that, we're going to close the call. So -- before we go, I just want to give one quick shout out to the team because I know, as I said earlier, we have quite a lot going on in Q4, whether it's on the planning side, on the product building side or on the sales side, where I said we have a really, really exciting pipeline. And so we have a lot to do. I want to thank the team for the hard work there. I also -- I'm looking forward to meeting a lot of our existing and new customers at AWS re:Invent in a few weeks, and I'll see you all there. Thank you all.
Operator: Thank you for your participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Financials‑vs‑History note:
English

1) Direct comparison (current quarter 2025-Q3 vs most similar past quarter 2024-Q3)
- Revenue
  - Past (2024-Q3): Revenue = "$690 million".
  - Current (2025-Q3): Revenue = "$886 million, an increase of 28% year‑over‑year..."
  - Comparison: Current revenue is higher (+$196M; ~28% vs past $690M). Year‑over‑year growth is slightly faster (28% vs 26%). Both quarters were reported as above the high end of guidance.

- Quarter‑over‑quarter revenue growth (sequential)
  - Past (2024-Q3): Comparable past entry referenced revenue $690M (no explicit q/q % shown).
  - Current (2025-Q3): "up 7% quarter‑over‑quarter"
  - Comparison: Current shows explicit q/q sequential growth (7%); past quarter did not report a comparable q/q increase in the cited item. Current is stronger on sequential momentum.

- Free cash flow
  - Past (2024-Q3): Free cash flow = "$204 million" (free cash flow margin 30%).
  - Current (2025-Q3): Free cash flow = "$214 million with a free cash flow margin of 24%".
  - Comparison: Free cash flow in dollars is slightly higher (+$10M). Free cash flow margin is lower (24% current vs 30% past) — cash conversion improved modestly in absolute dollars but margin compressed.

- Cash flow from operations
  - Past (2024-Q3): Comparable past entries focused on free cash flow ($204M) and not operating cash specifically.
  - Current (2025-Q3): Cash flow from operations = "$251 million in the quarter".
  - Comparison: Operating cash generation increased relative to the past free cash flow figure ($251M vs $204M), indicating stronger operating cash inflow in the quarter.

- Gross margin
  - Past (2024-Q3): Gross margin = "81.1%".
  - Current (2025-Q3): Gross margin = "81.2%... compared to 80.9% last quarter and 81.1% in the year ago quarter".
  - Comparison: Essentially flat to prior year (81.2% vs 81.1%); marginal improvement vs the immediate prior quarter (80.9%). Similar.

- Operating income and operating margin
  - Past (2024-Q3): Operating income = "$173 million" (25% margin).
  - Current (2025-Q3): Operating income = "$207 million for a 23% operating margin".
  - Comparison: Operating income in dollars is higher (+$34M). Operating margin is lower (23% current vs 25% year‑ago). So bottom‑line dollar profitability improved, but margin percentage compressed versus the year‑ago quarter.

- Billings
  - Past (2024-Q3): Billings = "$689 million".
  - Current (2025-Q3): Billings = "$893 million, up 30% year‑over‑year".
  - Comparison: Current billings are materially higher (+$204M) and growth is much stronger (30% vs 14% in the cited past).

- Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO)
  - Past (2024-Q3): RPO = "$1.82 billion" (up 26% YoY); current RPO growth described as "High 20%".
  - Current (2025-Q3): RPO = "$2.79 billion, up 53% year‑over‑year"; current RPO growth "low 50s% YoY".
  - Comparison: Current RPO is substantially higher (+$0.97B) and growth has roughly doubled (≈53% vs ~26%). Large acceleration in contracted backlog.

- Current RPO growth (explicit)
  - Past (2024-Q3): "High 20% year‑over‑year".
  - Current (2025-Q3): "low 50s percentage year‑over‑year".
  - Comparison: Current is much higher (low‑50s vs high‑20s) — clear acceleration.

- Customer counts (total)
  - Past (2024-Q3): "29,200 customers".
  - Current (2025-Q3): "about 32,000 customers".
  - Comparison: Current is higher (~+2,800 customers).

- Large customers (ARR ≥ $100k)
  - Past (2024-Q3): "3,490 customers".
  - Current (2025-Q3): "about 4,060 customers".
  - Comparison: Current is higher (+570 customers); these large customers now generate ~89% of ARR per current disclosure.

- Net revenue retention (trailing 12‑month)
  - Past (2024-Q3): "Mid‑110s".
  - Current (2025-Q3): "120% similar to last quarter".
  - Comparison: Current NRR is higher (120% vs mid‑110s) — improvement in retention/expansion.

- Gross revenue retention
  - Past (2024-Q3): "Mid‑to‑high 90s".
  - Current (2025-Q3): "remain in the mid‑ to high 90s".
  - Comparison: Similar (stable).

- Product / ARR composition (observability / digital experience / security)
  - Past (2024-Q3): Observability ARR "More than $2.5 billion"; AI/native and product counts noted (e.g., 15 products >$10M ARR).
  - Current (2025-Q3): Digital experience products "together exceed $300 million in ARR"; Security ARR growth mid‑50s YoY.
  - Comparison: Different sub‑metrics but show product expansion; cannot directly compare dollar totals for all product buckets from the cited past entries. Noted trend: security and digital experience ARR have meaningfully accelerated year over year.

- Operating expenditures (OpEx) growth
  - Past (2024-Q3): OPEX grew "21% year‑over‑year".
  - Current (2025-Q3): "Q3 OpEx grew 32% year‑over‑year, down from 36% last quarter".
  - Comparison: Current OpEx growth is higher than the past (32% vs 21%); growth rate is moderating sequentially (36% → 32%).

- Billings / New logo bookings / New customer contribution
  - Past (2024-Q3): Billings $689M (up 14%); AI/native contribution >6% of ARR; product adoption ~83%.
  - Current (2025-Q3): Billings $893M (up 30%); new logo annualized bookings "more than doubled year‑over‑year"; new customers contributed ~25% of YoY revenue growth (up from 20% in Q2).
  - Comparison: Material improvement in go‑to‑market results vs the past quarter.

2) Supported outcomes — where management explicitly referenced historical comparisons and the numbers confirm their comments
- Management said revenue was above the high end of guidance; confirmed — both 2025‑Q3 ($886M) and the comparable 2024‑Q3 ($690M) were reported as above the high end of guidance.
- Management noted operating margin vs last quarter and year‑ago: they reported 23% (2025‑Q3), compared to 20% last quarter and 25% in the year‑ago quarter. The past quarter figure (2024‑Q3 operating income = $173M at 25%) confirms the year‑ago 25% reference; current $207M confirms an increase in operating income dollars but margin sits between the two periods as management stated.
- Management stated strong acceleration in RPO/current RPO growth; confirmed by RPO rising from $1.82B (2024‑Q3) to $2.79B (2025‑Q3) and current RPO growth moving from high‑20s% to low‑50s% — a clear acceleration.
- Management said net revenue retention improved/held strong; confirmed — trailing‑12‑month NRR is 120% in 2025‑Q3 vs mid‑110s in the 2024‑Q3 reference.
- Management pointed to stronger billings and new logos; confirmed — billings rose to $893M (30% YoY) from $689M (14% YoY in the past) and new‑logo bookings more than doubled year‑over‑year.
- Bottom‑line focus: management’s statements are supported by higher absolute operating income ($207M vs $173M) and higher operating cash flow ($251M vs the prior free cash flow $204M). However, percentage margins (operating margin and free cash flow margin) are compressed vs the year‑ago quarter (operating margin 23% vs 25%; FCF margin 24% vs 30%), which management also acknowledged in comparative remarks.

Historical‑Calls note:
English

1) Validate past guidances (previous forward-looking statements)
- 2024‑Q4 non‑GAAP operating income full‑year guidance ($655M–$675M): BEAT (by guidance). The company’s FY‑2025 non‑GAAP operating income guidance given in 2025‑Q3 is $754M–$758M, materially above the prior $655M–$675M range.
  - Concrete numbers: prior guidance $655M–$675M → current FY‑2025 guidance $754M–$758M.
- 2025‑Q2 capex/capitalized software guidance (4%–5% of revenue for FY‑2025): CONSISTENT / NARROWED. The company’s current FY‑2025 expectation is 4% of revenues, which sits at the low end of the prior 4%–5% range.
  - Concrete numbers: prior guidance 4%–5% → current expectation 4%.
- All other prior forward‑looking items in the provided historical list (Q4 2024 revenue guidance, FY2024 revenue/EPS guidance, Q4 non‑GAAP operating income guidance for 2024, etc.) cannot be directly compared to 2025‑Q3 realized metrics in the facts you provided, so omitted.

2) Compare results being discussed (selected, concrete comparisons)
- Revenue: Q3 2025 revenue was $886M (up 28% YoY) vs. historical Q3 ($690M, +26% YoY). This shows higher absolute revenue and a slightly stronger YoY growth rate versus the year‑ago Q3.
- Billings: Q3 2025 billings were $893M (+30% YoY) vs. prior Q3 billings $689M (+14% YoY) — both absolute billings and YoY growth accelerated materially.
- Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO): Q3 2025 RPO $2.79B (+53% YoY) vs. prior $1.82B (+26% YoY) — backlog roughly +$0.97B higher and RPO growth rate roughly doubled.
- Current RPO growth: previously “high‑20s% YoY” (historical) → Q3 2025 “low‑50s% YoY” (current) — clear acceleration in contracted future revenue growth.
- Free cash flow: Q3 2025 FCF $214M (24% margin) vs. prior Q3 FCF $204M (30% margin) — FCF dollar amount modestly higher but margin lower versus the prior comparable quarter.
- Operating income / margin: Q3 2025 operating income $207M (23% margin) vs. prior Q3 $173M (25% margin) — higher dollars but a slightly lower margin vs. the year‑ago quarter.
- Gross margin: Q3 2025 = 81.2% vs. prior Q3 = 81.1% — essentially stable.
- Customers: Q3 2025 about 32,000 customers vs. ~29,200 a year ago — +≈2,800 customers.
- Large customers (ARR ≥ $100K): Q3 2025 about 4,060 vs. ~3,490 a year ago — +≈570 large customers; these generate ~89% of ARR.
- Net revenue retention: Q3 2025 trailing 12‑month NRR = 120% vs. mid‑110s trailing 12‑month historically — improvement in retention.
- Product adoption: Q3 2025 — 84% of customers use 2+ products (up from 83% a year ago); 54% use 4+ (up from 49% a year ago); 31% use 6+ (up from 26% a year ago) — steady expansion in cross‑product penetration.
- New‑logo bookings: previously reported “new‑logo dollar bookings up over 70% YoY (2025‑Q1)” → Q3 2025 “new logo annualized bookings more than doubled YoY” — acceleration from ~70% to 100%+ growth.
- AI‑native cohort: prior (2025‑Q2) AI native contribution ≈11% of revenues → Q3 2025 this group = 12% of revenue (up from ~6% year over year earlier) and their YoY revenue growth accelerated in Q3.
- Security ARR growth: was mid‑40s% last quarter (historical disclosure) → Q3 2025 security ARR growth mid‑50s% YoY — acceleration quarter‑over‑quarter.

Peers note:
English

- Q3 2025 revenue ($886M, +28% YoY, above guidance): Datadog emphasizes an above‑range beat and strong YoY growth ("$886 million, an increase of 28% year‑over‑year and above the high end of our guidance range"). Comparable firms frame guidance as continuation of momentum (e.g., ANET: "Q3 2025 Revenue Guidance" "$2.25 billion" — "Expected to continue momentum from Q2 2025") or give larger absolute guidance ranges (SNPS, SMCI). Datadog’s reasoning stresses out‑performance vs. its own guidance rather than merely projecting continuation like peers.

- Q3 2025 quarter‑over‑quarter revenue growth (up 7%): Datadog reports realized sequential growth ("up 7% quarter‑over‑quarter"). Peers report similar or higher sequential gains but frame them as momentum indicators (PLTR: "Sequential Revenue Growth" "7%" — "Third quarter revenue grew 7% sequentially"; HPE: "Total Revenue Growth Q4" "9% quarter‑over‑quarter"). Datadog’s messaging aligns in magnitude with some peers but ties the cadence to product mix and demand commentary rather than only to seasonal/operational factors.

- Q3 2025 free cash flow ($214M, 24% margin): Datadog highlights both dollar FCF and a large free‑cash‑flow margin ("$214 million with a free cash flow margin of 24%"). Comparable historical calls often report absolute FCF figures without the same margin emphasis (BAX: "Q3 2025 Free Cash Flow" "$126 million"; IQV: "Second quarter cash flow" "$292 million"). Datadog stresses cash conversion efficiency (margin) more explicitly than many peers who report absolute dollars.

- Q3 2025 gross margin (81.2%): Datadog reports a high, stable gross margin ("81.2%... compared to 80.9% last quarter and 81.1% in the year ago quarter"). Peers give comparable high adjusted margins or ranges (PLTR: "Adjusted Gross Margin" 84%; FFIV: "Q3 Non‑GAAP Gross Margins" "82% to 83%"). Datadog’s narrative emphasizes stability quarter‑to‑quarter; peers often present expected ranges or single‑quarter adjusted figures.

- Q3 2025 operating income and margin ($207M, 23%): Datadog reports realized operating profit and an improving margin ("$207 million for a 23% operating margin compared to 20% last quarter"). Some peers report similar percentages as context (DXCM: "Operating income for Q3 2025" "$272.9 million" — "Representing 22.6% of revenue"), while others show materially higher margins (SNPS: "Q3 Operating Margin" "38.5%"). Datadog frames margin improvement as sequential progress; peers vary widely in absolute margin levels.

- Q3 2025 billings ($893M, +30% YoY): Datadog emphasizes strong billings growth ("$893 million, up 30% year‑over‑year"). Peers report billings/revenue growth but often at lower rates or different scales (FTNT: "Total billings" "$1.78 billion" — grew 15%). Datadog’s reasoning highlights rapid contract activity (high YoY billings growth) that outpaces many peers’ reported billings growth rates.

- Q3 2025 RPO ($2.79B, +53% YoY): Datadog points to a rapidly growing contracted backlog ("$2.79 billion, up 53% year‑over‑year"). Larger peers report much larger RPO balances (ORCL: "Remaining performance obligation (RPO)" "$97.3 billion" — "up 50% in constant currency"; NTAP: "Remaining Performance Obligations" "$4.5 billion"). Datadog emphasizes high percentage growth from a smaller absolute base; peers emphasize very large absolute backlog balances.

- Q3 2025 current RPO growth (low 50s % YoY): Datadog reports very strong current RPO growth ("current RPO growth was in the low 50s percentage year‑over‑year"). Comparable firms show notably lower current‑RPO growth rates in historical calls (FTNT: "Current RPO Growth" "15%"; NOW: "Current RPO" growth ~20.5%). Datadog’s RPO acceleration is materially stronger in percentage terms than many peers’ reported current‑RPO growth.

- Q3 2025 cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ($4.1B): Datadog discloses a healthy cash balance ("$4.1 billion at quarter end"). Several larger peers report substantially larger cash piles (ORCL: "Cash and marketable securities" "$11.3 billion"). Datadog’s reasoning highlights liquidity but at a smaller absolute scale versus very large incumbents.

- Total customers at end of Q3 2025 (~32,000): Datadog reports a large installed base ("about 32,000 customers up from about 29,200 a year ago"). Some peers emphasize higher percentage customer growth from smaller bases (PLTR: "Customer Count Growth (Q3)" "39%" — to 629 customers) or different absolute scales (NOW: "Number of customers at year‑end 2023" "Over 8,100"). Datadog presents steady expansion in a large base; peers sometimes emphasize higher percentage gains off smaller bases.

- Large customers (ARR ≥ $100k) ~4,060, generated ~89% of ARR: Datadog highlights concentration of ARR among large accounts ("about 4,060 customers... these customers generated about 89% of our ARR"). Comparable calls do not uniformly present the same concentration metric in the provided history, though strong retention metrics from peers imply enterprise dependency (e.g., WDAY: "Gross revenue retention rates" "Over 95%"). Datadog explicitly emphasizes the role of large customers in ARR more than many peers’ public remarks.

- Digital experience products ARR (exceed $300M): Datadog reports absolute product ARR ("these digital experience products together exceed $300 million in ARR"). Peers typically state growth percentages or combined ARR expectations for product groups (AKAM: "Combined ARR Growth for High‑Growth Security Solutions" "30% to 35%"). Datadog gives an absolute ARR figure for a product category, whereas peers often highlight growth rates.

- Security ARR growth mid‑50s % YoY in Q3: Datadog reports very strong security ARR growth ("Security ARR growth was in the mid‑50s percentage year‑over‑year in Q3, up from the mid‑40s we mentioned last quarter"). Peers forecast lower security ARR growth ranges historically (AKAM: "Combined ARR Growth for High‑Growth Security Solutions" "30% to 35%"). Datadog’s security growth outpaces the higher‑growth ranges reported by some peers.

- Revenue growth excluding AI‑native customers (20% YoY, up from 18% in Q2): Datadog calls out non‑AI cohort acceleration ("In Q3, our revenue growth, excluding the AI native customer group, was 20% year‑over‑year, accelerating from 18% year‑over‑year in Q2"). Comparable firms discuss AI‑driven or double‑digit organic growth (EPAM: "Year‑over‑year organic growth" "Double‑digit growth"). Datadog highlights that even non‑AI revenue is accelerating — a specific segmentation many peers note qualitatively but may not quantify the same way.

- Net revenue retention (TTM 120%): Datadog reports a strong trailing‑12‑month NRR ("Our trailing 12‑month net revenue retention percentage was 120% similar to last quarter"). Some peers report slightly higher NRRs historically (AXON: "Net Revenue Retention Rate" "124%"; "123%"). Datadog’s NRR is robust and in the same high‑teens/low‑120s band, though a bit below the very highest peer figures.

- Gross revenue retention (mid‑ to high‑90s): Datadog reports high gross retention ("our trailing 12‑month gross revenue retention percentage remain in the mid‑ to high 90s"). Peers report similar high levels (WDAY: "Gross revenue retention rates" "98%"; "Over 95%"). Datadog’s gross retention aligns with strong‑retention peers.

- New logo annualized bookings more than doubled YoY and set a record: Datadog highlights outsized new‑logo bookings ("New logo annualized bookings more than doubled year‑over‑year and set a new record"). Peers have used similar language for bookings acceleration (ABNB: "Year‑over‑year growth in bookings" "Doubled in expansion markets"; AXON: "Record Q1 booking results"). Datadog’s message mirrors peers emphasizing record new‑business momentum.

- Q4 2025 revenue guidance ($912M–$916M, +24% YoY): Datadog gives a tight guidance range and strong growth ("revenue to be in the range of $912 million to $916 million, which represents a 24% year‑over‑year growth"). Peers provide quarter guidance ranges at different scales (PLTR: "Q1 2025 Revenue Guidance" "$858 million to $862 million"). Datadog’s guidance is framed as both tight and growthy relative to prior quarters.

- Q4 2025 non‑GAAP operating income guidance ($216M–$220M, ~24% margin): Datadog implies a 24% operating margin. Some peers target higher margins (EBAY: "Q4 Operating Margin Guidance" "Between 25.8% and 26.3%") while others guide lower (DXCM: "Expected non‑GAAP operating margin for 2025" "Approximately 21%"). Datadog’s guidance sits between peer examples and is presented as a maintained/high level of profitability.

- Q4 2025 non‑GAAP EPS guidance ($0.54–$0.56, ~367M shares): Datadog provides per‑share guidance with share base. Historical peer guidance shows different EPS magnitudes (AKAM: "Non‑GAAP EPS Guidance for Q4" "$1.65 to $1.85"; SNPS: "$2.76 to $2.80"). Datadog’s EPS guidance is lower in absolute dollars — reflecting different business models/float — but is presented precisely with share count like peers.

- FY 2025 revenue guidance ($3.386B–$3.390B, +26% YoY): Datadog gives a narrow full‑year range and 26% growth. Peers’ full‑year revenue guidance varies in scale and growth (PLTR: "Full‑Year 2025 Revenue Guidance" "$3.741 billion to $3.757 billion"). Datadog emphasizes strong growth while operating at a different absolute revenue scale versus some peers.

- FY 2025 non‑GAAP operating income guidance ($754M–$758M, ~22% margin): Datadog targets a ~22% operating margin for FY25. Peers have varied margin expectations (WDAY: "FY 2025 Non‑GAAP Operating Margin Expectation" "Approximately 25%"; DXCM: "Expected non‑GAAP operating profit margin for 2025" "Approximately 21%"). Datadog’s guidance lands mid‑pack among peers.

- FY 2025 non‑GAAP EPS guidance ($2.00–$2.02, ~364M shares): Datadog provides full‑year EPS and share count. Peers sometimes report materially higher per‑share guidance (SNPS: "Non‑GAAP Earnings Guidance for Fiscal Year 2025" "$12.76 to $12.80 per share"). Datadog’s EPS is lower in absolute terms but presented with the same disclosure style (range + share base).

- FY 2025 capex & capitalized software (4% of revenue): Datadog expects capex + capitalized software at 4% of revenues ("we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 4% of revenues"). Comparable historical guidance from peers is similar (EBAY: "2025 Capital Expenditures" "4% to 5% of revenue"). Datadog’s guidance aligns with peers on capex intensity.

- Demand environment characterization ("broad‑based positive trends... ongoing strength of cloud migration and digital transformation"): Datadog frames the macro as broadly positive ("We have seen broad‑based positive trends in the demand environment with an ongoing strength of cloud migration and digital transformation"). Peers range from modest optimism (EPAM: "Modestly more positive demand environment") to very strong demand characterizations (ORCL: "Stunning level of demand"). Datadog’s wording sits between EPAM’s cautious tone and ORCL’s very strong depiction.

- Non‑AI demand environment ("positive in general... not massive acceleration"): Datadog describes non‑AI demand as positive but not accelerating dramatically ("the demand environment is not -- is positive in general. I don't know that we see massive acceleration of cloud migration, but at least the environment is not pushing the other way"). This mirrors peers describing stability (NOW: "General Economic Environment for IT Spending" "Stable") or caution about broad macro improvement (FFIV: "Macro Environment Condition" "Does not assume a significant improvement to the macro environment").

- Hyperscaler growth context (not GPU‑driven for Datadog's growth): Datadog distinguishes its growth from GPU/hyperscaler GPU‑driven expansion ("there's been a very, very high growth of hyperscaler revenue... A lot of that is GPU related, but the growth we're seeing here... is largely not GPU‑related"). Peers focused on GPU‑driven compute growth (NVDA: "Compute Revenue Growth" "More than 5x" — "Driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform"). Datadog’s reasoning is to separate its growth drivers (non‑GPU enterprise/cloud usage) from the GPU‑led hyperscaler narratives emphasized by GPU vendors.

Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)

- Q3 2025 營收（$886M，+28% YoY，高於指引）：Datadog 強調超出區間且年增顯著（"$886 million, an increase of 28% year‑over‑‑year and above the high end of our guidance range"）。可比公司則以延續動能來表述指引（ANET: "Q3 2025 Revenue Guidance" "$2.25 billion" — "Expected to continue momentum from Q2 2025"），或提供不同絕對規模的指引範圍（SNPS、SMCI）。Datadog 的論述重點在於超越自身指引，而非僅陳述延續性。

- Q3 2025 環比營收成長（+7%）：Datadog 報告實現的季增（"up 7% quarter‑over‑quarter"）。同業以相似或更高的季增來表述為成長動能（PLTR: "Sequential Revenue Growth" "7%" — "Third quarter revenue grew 7% sequentially"; HPE: "Total Revenue Growth Q4" "9% quarter‑over‑quarter"）。Datadog 敘述在幅度上與部分同業一致，但更強調產品組合與需求脈動，而非僅歸因於季節/營運因素。

- Q3 2025 自由現金流（$214M，24% 率）：Datadog 同時強調現金金額與高現金轉換率（"$214 million with a free cash flow margin of 24%"）。可比公司往往只報絕對現金數字而非同樣著重「現金率」（BAX: "Q3 2025 Free Cash Flow" "$126 million"; IQV: "Second quarter cash flow" "$292 million"）。Datadog 比較明確突顯現金轉換效率（margin）的重要性。

- Q3 2025 毛利率（81.2%）：Datadog 報告高且穩定的毛利（"81.2%... compared to 80.9% last quarter and 81.1% in the year ago quarter"）。可比公司也呈現高調整後毛利或範圍（PLTR: "Adjusted Gross Margin" 84%; FFIV: "Q3 Non‑GAAP Gross Margins" "82% to 83%"）。Datadog 的敘述強調季比季穩定性；同業則常以預期範圍或單季調整數字呈現。

- Q3 2025 營業利益與營業邊際（$207M，23%）：Datadog 報出已實現營利與邊際改善（"$207 million for a 23% operating margin compared to 20% last quarter"）。部份同業提供相近百分比以供參考（DXCM: "Operating income for Q3 2025" "$272.9 million" — "Representing 22.6% of revenue"），但也有同業毛利顯著更高（SNPS: "Q3 Operating Margin" "38.5%"）。Datadog 將邊際改善呈為序列性進步；同業在絕對邊際上差異較大。

- Q3 2025 帳單（$893M，+30% YoY）：Datadog 強調帳單成長強勁（"$893 million, up 30% year‑over‑year"）。同業報告的帳單或營收成長率通常較低或尺度不同（FTNT: "Total billings" "$1.78 billion" — grew 15%）。Datadog 的論述突顯合約活動的急速上升，超過許多同業報告的帳單成長率。

- Q3 2025 RPO（$2.79B，+53% YoY）：Datadog 指出合約待履行餘額快速增長（"$2.79 billion, up 53% year‑over‑year"）。較大型同業報告的 RPO 絕對值遠大（ORCL: "Remaining performance obligation (RPO)" "$97.3 billion" — "up 50% in constant currency"; NTAP: "Remaining Performance Obligations" "$4.5 billion"）。Datadog 強調高百分比成長但基期較小；同業則強調極大的絕對備貨。

- Q3 2025 當期 RPO 成長（低 50% 區間 YoY）：Datadog 報告當期 RPO 成長非常強勁（"current RPO growth was in the low 50s percentage year‑over‑year"）。可比公司歷史公布的當期 RPO 成長較低（FTNT: "Current RPO Growth" "15%"; NOW: "Current RPO" ~20.5% growth）。Datadog 的 RPO 加速在百分比上明顯超過多數同業。

- Q3 2025 現金、現金等價物與有價證券（$4.1B）：Datadog 披露穩健現金位（"$4.1 billion at quarter end"）。一些大型同業披露更大的現金規模（ORCL: "Cash and marketable securities" "$11.3 billion"）。Datadog 的敘述強調流動性，但絕對規模小於部分巨頭。

- Q3 2025 期末總客戶數（約 32,000）：Datadog 報出龐大且穩健的客戶基數（"about 32,000 customers up from about 29,200 a year ago"）。可比公司有時自較小基數呈現更高百分比成長（PLTR: "Customer Count Growth (Q3)" "39%" — to 629 customers），或不同絕對尺度（NOW: "Number of customers at year‑end 2023" "Over 8,100"）。Datadog 呈現的是在大型基數下的穩健擴張；同業有時強調較高的百分比成長。

- 大客戶（ARR ≥ $100k）約 4,060，約佔 89% ARR：Datadog 強調 ARR 高度集中於大型帳戶（"about 4,060 customers... these customers generated about 89% of our ARR"）。提供資料中的可比通話未普遍同樣呈現此集中比，但高留存數據暗示大型企業依賴（WDAY: "Gross revenue retention rates" "Over 95%"）。Datadog 更明確突顯大型客戶對 ARR 的貢獻度。

- 數位體驗產品 ARR（超過 $300M）：Datadog 揭露產品線的絕對 ARR（"these digital experience products together exceed $300 million in ARR"）。同業常以成長率或期望值表述產品群（AKAM: "Combined ARR Growth for High‑Growth Security Solutions" "30% to 35%"）。Datadog 報出絕對 ARR，而同業較常強調成長幅度。

- 安全 ARR 成長（Q3 中旬 50%+ YoY）：Datadog 報告非常強的安全類 ARR 成長（"Security ARR growth was in the mid‑50s percentage year‑over‑year in Q3, up from the mid‑40s we mentioned last quarter"）。同業對安全類預期較低（AKAM: "Combined ARR Growth for High‑Growth Security Solutions" "30% to 35%"）。Datadog 的安全成長率明顯超越某些同業的預期範圍。

- 排除 AI‑native 的營收成長（20% YoY，由 Q2 的 18% 加速）：Datadog 指出非 AI 客戶群的成長也在加速（"In Q3, our revenue growth, excluding the AI native customer group, was 20% year‑over‑year, accelerating from 18% year‑over‑year in Q2"）。同業也談到 AI 及有機雙位數成長（EPAM: "Year‑over‑year organic growth" "Double‑digit growth"）。Datadog 明確量化非 AI 組別的加速，這是同業有時僅定性描述的層面。

- 淨收入留存率（TTM 120%）：Datadog 報出強勁的 TTM NRR（"Our trailing 12‑month net revenue retention percentage was 120% similar to last quarter"）。部分同業歷史值略高（AXON: "Net Revenue Retention Rate" "124%"; "123%"）。Datadog 的 NRR 與高留存同業同屬強勢區間，但略低於個別更高值。

- 毛收入留存率（mid‑ to high‑90s）：Datadog 報出高毛留存（"our trailing 12‑month gross revenue retention percentage remain in the mid‑ to high 90s"）。同業也有類似高水準（WDAY: "Gross revenue retention rates" "98%"; "Over 95%"）。Datadog 與同業在毛留存上保持一致的良好表現。

- 新客（new logo）年化簽約量年增超過 2 倍並創新高：Datadog 強調新客簽約顯著成長（"New logo annualized bookings more than doubled year‑over‑year and set a new record"）。同業也以類似語句描述簽約動能（ABNB: "Year‑over‑year growth in bookings" "Doubled in expansion markets"; AXON: "Record Q1 booking results"）。Datadog 的訊息與同業強調創紀錄新客動能的說法一致。

- Q4 2025 營收指引（$912M–$916M，+24% YoY）：Datadog 給出緊湊的指引區間並預期強勁成長（"revenue to be in the range of $912 million to $916 million, which represents a 24% year‑over‑year growth"）。可比公司也會提供季度指引（PLTR: "Q1 2025 Revenue Guidance" "$858 million to $862 million"）。Datadog 的指引以「窄幅且成長較高」為表述重點。

- Q4 2025 非 GAAP 營業利益指引（$216M–$220M，約 24% margin）：Datadog 隱含 24% 營業邊際。部分同業指引更高（EBAY: "Q4 Operating Margin Guidance" "Between 25.8% and 26.3%"），也有較低的（DXCM: "Approximately 21%"）。Datadog 的指引介於同業範例之間，並主張維持高獲利水準。

- Q4 2025 非 GAAP 每股盈餘指引（$0.54–$0.56，約 367M 股）：Datadog 提供每股指引與股本基數。歷史同業的每股數字絕對值差距較大（AKAM: "Non‑GAAP EPS Guidance for Q4" "$1.65 to $1.85"; SNPS: "$2.76 to $2.80"）。Datadog 的 EPS 指引絕對數較低，但與同業一樣提供範圍與股本預估。

- FY 2025 營收指引（$3.386B–$3.390B，+26% YoY）：Datadog 提供窄幅全年指引並預期 26% 成長。可比公司全年指引在規模與數字上不同（PLTR: "Full‑Year 2025 Revenue Guidance" "$3.741 billion to $3.757 billion"）。Datadog 強調高成長但在絕對營收規模上與部分同業不同。

- FY 2025 非 GAAP 營業利益指引（$754M–$758M，約 22% margin）：Datadog 目標約 22% 營業邊際。可比公司預期有高有低（WDAY: "Approximately 25%"; DXCM: "Approximately 21%"）。Datadog 的指引屬於同業中等偏上水準。

- FY 2025 非 GAAP EPS 指引（$2.00–$2.02，約 364M 股）：Datadog 提供全年 EPS 與股本估計。某些同業的每股指引遠高（SNPS: "Non‑GAAP Earnings Guidance for Fiscal Year 2025" "$12.76 to $12.80 per share"）。Datadog 的 EPS 絕對值較低，但資訊披露格式（範圍 + 股本）與同業一致。

- FY 2025 資本支出與資本化軟體佔收入比例（4%）：Datadog 預期 CapEx + capitalized software 為 4% 收入（"we expect capital expenditures and capitalized software together to be 4% of revenues"）。可比公司歷史上也有相近指引（EBAY: "2025 Capital Expenditures" "4% to 5% of revenue"）。Datadog 在資本強度預期上與同業一致。

- 需求環境描述（「廣泛正向趨勢...持續的雲端遷移與數位轉型」）：Datadog 將宏觀敘述為「廣泛正向」並指向雲端遷移（"We have seen broad‑based positive trends in the demand environment with an ongoing strength of cloud migration and digital transformation"）。同業語氣從較保守（EPAM: "Modestly more positive demand environment"）到非常強（ORCL: "Stunning level of demand"）。Datadog 的觀點介於 EPAM 的謹慎與 ORCL 的強烈樂觀之間。

- 非 AI 的需求環境（「整體正向，但無大幅加速」）：Datadog 表示非 AI 需求「整體正向但未見大幅加速」（"the demand environment is not -- is positive in general. I don't know that we see massive acceleration of cloud migration, but at least the environment is not pushing the other way"）。此說法與同業表述的穩定性相近（NOW: "Stable"；FFIV: "Does not assume a significant improvement to the macro environment"）。Datadog 表述與同業穩健、中性觀點一致。

- Hyperscaler 成長脈絡（Datadog 成長「大多非 GPU 驅動」）：Datadog 區分其成長來源，指出雲端超大客戶的高成長多為 GPU（但 Datadog 的成長「大多非 GPU 相關」）（"there's been a very, very high growth of hyperscaler revenue... A lot of that is GPU related, but the growth we're seeing here... is largely not GPU‑related"）。可比廠商則強調 GPU 帶動的運算收入暴增（NVDA: "Compute Revenue Growth" "More than 5x" — "Driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform"）。Datadog 的論述意在將自家成長驅動因素與 GPU/超大雲端的潮流區隔開來。

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

---

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

ORIGINAL EARNINGS CALL TRANSCRIPT:
---
Matthew: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines September Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode until we conduct a question and answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. If you have any questions or comments during the presentation, you may press 1 on your phone to enter the question queue at any time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.
Julie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the September 2025 earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are our CEO, Ed Bastian, our President, Glen Hauenstein, and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta Air Lines' performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask you to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. As a reminder, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta Air Lines' SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ed.
Ed Bastian: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. This quarter's results reinforce that Delta Air Lines' competitive advantages and differentiation have never been more evident. In September, Delta Air Lines' revenue growth and earnings came in at the top end of our expectations, delivering performance that we anticipate will lead the industry across all key financial measures. Revenue grew 4%, led by premium, corporate, and loyalty, reflecting the power of Delta Air Lines' brand, the financial strength of our customer base, and improving industry fundamentals. We reported pretax income of $1.5 billion and earnings of $1.71 per share, an 11.2% operating margin. Free cash was $830 million, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $2.8 billion. We generated a return on invested capital of 13%, five points above our cost of capital in the top half of the S&P 500. Operationally, Delta Air Lines once again led the industry on reliability and customer experience. Through a busy summer, our teams delivered for our customers, and I want to thank them for their outstanding work and dedication. Professionalism and care create the trust consumers have in the Delta Air Lines brand. Sharing success with our people is core to our culture. We've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing because when Delta Air Lines succeeds, so should our people. I also want to recognize the essential aviation work of the controllers, TSA officers, federal air marshals, and many others who are keeping our system safe and secure during the ongoing government shutdown. Thank you for your professionalism and your commitment to the traveling public. We're hopeful that Congress will act to reopen the government as soon as possible. Now turning to our outlook, fundamentals are improving, and the positive momentum is continuing. Since July, travel demand has strengthened, led by a rebound in business travel, which was up high single digits in the quarter. The US economy remains on solid footing, and our customer base is financially strong. Rising preference for premium products and services, SkyMiles membership is expanding, particularly among younger consumers, and engagement is strong across all cohorts. Spending on the Delta Air Lines Amex co-brand card is up double digits year-to-date, with a recent acceleration in travel and entertainment that mirrors the improvement that we're seeing in bookings. Premium revenue growth remains robust. The main cabin trends are improving. Structural change has taken hold across the industry. As unprofitable flying is rationalized, and carriers not earning their cost of capital adjust strategies to prioritize returns. Against this backdrop, we expect to deliver a double-digit operating margin again in December, with earnings comparable to what we earned in September. This would be at or above our all-time fourth-quarter earnings performance. This brings our outlook for full-year earnings to approximately $6 per share, which is in the upper half of our July guidance range. Free cash generation remains a key differentiator for Delta Air Lines, and we are updating our full-year outlook to $3.5 billion to $4 billion, growing our cash generation over last year and consistent with our long-term framework as we build a fortress balance sheet. At the heart of our position of industry leadership is a relentless focus on elevating the customer experience. We're investing across every phase of the journey to make travel with Delta Air Lines more seamless, personalized, and premium, growing our value proposition to customers. On the ground, we're harvesting the benefits of generational investments in our airport infrastructure. This includes upgraded airport facilities, modernized sky clubs, and the launch of Delta One lounges in JFK, LAX, Boston, and Seattle. By year-end, Delta One check-in will be available across all of our hubs. We've also partnered with Uber to begin streamlining the airport pickup and drop-off experiences, enhancing convenience from curb to gate. In the air, we're continuing to expand premium seating and enhanced service offerings, ensuring more customers can experience our most elevated products. Digitally, delivering a connected experience for SkyMiles members, with nearly 1,000 aircraft equipped with fast, free Wi-Fi, well more than all of our US competitors combined, our integrated platform is setting the standard for in-flight connectivity and personalization. Exclusive partnerships with American Express, Uber, and most recently, YouTube, extend SkyMiles further into our members' daily activities, deepening engagement and preference for the Delta Air Lines brand beyond the flight. It's all powered by our people, delivering welcomed, elevated, and caring service that reinforces our industry leadership, sustains our durable revenue premium, and underpins our strong financial foundation. In closing, our financial focus remains on profitable growth, margin expansion, and disciplined capital allocation, all aligned with the three to five-year framework that we shared last November. As we enter the final stretch of our centennial year, I'm more optimistic than ever about Delta Air Lines' future. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll hand it over to Glen to discuss our commercial trends and demand, followed by Dan with the financial details.
Glen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to begin by thanking the Delta Air Lines team for their outstanding commitment throughout the busy summer season and to our customers for their continued loyalty to Delta Air Lines. For September, revenue increased 4.1% year-over-year to $15.2 billion, a third-quarter record and ahead of our guidance as momentum built through the quarter. Trends across our business are improving, and customer preference for the Delta Air Lines brand is showing up in our results. Total unit revenue improved by 0.3% over last year. Importantly, domestic unit revenue turned positive, with sequential improvement as the quarter progressed. This was supported by a main cabin inflection as industry supply moderated and demand improved, materializing earlier than our initial expectations. Internationally, profitability across all entities was strong, with premium continuing to bolster results. Corporate sales trended positively throughout the quarter, up 8% over the prior year, with sequential improvement across all sectors. Domestic corporate sales grew double digits, including mid-teens growth in our coastal hubs. We see opportunities for further growth as corporate confidence rebuilds, reinforced by 90% of our most recent corporate survey respondents anticipating that their 2026 travel volumes will increase or remain steady year-over-year. Diverse high-margin revenue streams grew double digits year-over-year and contributed 60% of total revenue. Within that, premium revenue grew 9% with improvement across all products driven by strong demand and consistent investment in premium offerings. Loyalty revenue improved 9%, and travel-adjacent products grew mid-teens as SkyMiles members engaged beyond the flight and throughout our loyalty ecosystem. Cargo revenues increased 19% driven by the Pacific, Maintenance, repair, and overhaul revenue grew more than 60% on higher volumes and timing of shipments. Delta Air Lines' loyalty ecosystem continues to be a powerful driver of enterprise value. Anchored by the attractiveness of the SkyMiles program, a financially healthy, highly engaged member base, and our exclusive co-brand partnership with American Express. Co-brand holders are among our most valuable customers, traveling more often and spending more on Delta Air Lines. While roughly one-third of active SkyMiles members hold a co-brand card today, we have further runway as both engagement and member penetration continue to rise. A key proof point is the sustained momentum on spend growth, which has outpaced other consumer credit cards by 2x over the last few years. During the quarter, spend grew at a double-digit pace, with new card acquisitions up year-over-year and a record mix of customers choosing the premium cards. With that, remuneration from American Express increased 12% over the prior year to $2 billion in the quarter, keeping us on track to deliver over $8 billion this year and advancing towards our long-term goal of $10 billion within the next few years. Turning to the outlook, the environment continues to improve. Over the past six weeks, sales trends have accelerated across all geographies and in every advanced purchase window, positioning Delta Air Lines to close the year from a position of strength. While we are monitoring potential impacts from the US government shutdown, we have not seen a material effect to date. For December, we expect total revenue to grow 2% to 4% year-over-year on top of last year's record performance with solidly profitable unit revenues. Passenger RASM is showing healthy improvement sequentially, reflecting continued strength in domestic and a step-change improvement in the transatlantic, on firmer main cabin trends and corporate demand. At the same time, financial divergence across the industry has never been greater. As carriers prioritize earnings over their cost of capital, eliminate unprofitable flying, competitive capacity in our hubs is down year-over-year, and we expect a very healthy supply-demand balance across the industry into 2026. In closing, I'm very optimistic as we enter the final quarter, building our momentum and positioning Delta Air Lines for continued top-line growth and margin expansion into 2026. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to cover the financials.
Dan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Delta Air Lines' competitive advantages drove another strong quarter as we continue to set the pace for the industry. Our teams are delivering operationally for our customers and driving efficiency. Year-to-date, we are outperforming the industry across on-time performance, completion factor, and net promoter score. Our premium offerings, industry-leading loyalty programs, and elevated experiences we provide across the entire travel journey are driving increased customer preference for flying Delta Air Lines and underpinning our differentiated financial results. In September, we delivered record third-quarter revenue of $15.2 billion with an operating margin of 11.2% and earnings of $1.71 per share. Non-fuel unit cost growth was approximately flat to the prior year, bringing the year-to-date non-fuel unit cost growth to less than 2%, consistent with our low single-digit guidance at the start of the year, even as we've reduced capacity after the summer peak to align with demand. I want to thank the entire Delta Air Lines team for their hard work to achieve these results. Delta Air Lines generated third-quarter operating cash flow of $1.8 billion, and after reinvesting $1.1 billion into the business, we generated free cash flow of $830 million. On our capital structure, we continue to take an opportunistic approach. Last month, we successfully repriced our SkyMiles term loan, reducing the rate by 225 basis points. This demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and the attractiveness of Delta Air Lines' credit. Strong cash generation has enabled debt paydown of nearly $2 billion year-to-date, with gross leverage ending the quarter at 2.4 times. Now turning to the outlook, for December, as Glen shared, we expect revenue growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year with positive unit revenue. On the cost side, disciplined execution supports non-fuel unit cost growth in low single digits in line with our full-year guidance. With that, we expect fourth-quarter earnings of $1.6 to $1.9 per share and an operating margin of 10.5% to 12%. For the full year, this brings earnings per share of approximately $6 in the upper half of our guidance range we provided in July. On free cash flow, we are updating our guidance to $3.5 to $4 billion. This outlook is within our long-term target range and enables us to pay down debt while returning cash to shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: reinvesting where returns are strong, reducing debt, and maintaining our fortress investment-grade balance sheet, which was recently recognized by Fitch with a revised outlook from stable to positive during the quarter. Our investments are focused on the customer experience, as Ed and Glen spoke about, and on driving efficiency through technology and our fleet. We continue to advance our fleet renewal strategy with approximately 40 aircraft deliveries this year and next. These additions drive meaningful value for our customers through expanded premium seating and for our shareholders through increased efficiency and greater scale among our key fleets. Looking into 2026 and beyond, our focus is on profitable growth and delivering long-term financial targets outlined at our Investor Day last November, including earnings growth, durable free cash flow, and debt repayment to drive sustained value for our shareholders. In closing, I want to extend my sincere thanks to the entire Delta Air Lines team for their commitment to one another and to our customers. And with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.
Julie Stewart: Thank you, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to enter the call queue and go to our first question from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI?
Matthew: Certainly. Everyone, at this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. Your first question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Hey. Thank you. Good morning. With respect to the strong improvement in cash flow year-over-year and operating cash flow, can you just expand on the drivers of that improvement? How much of that is just the working capital benefit of maybe the booking curve normalizing versus earlier in the year? Maybe there's dynamics around MRO. Any thoughts you have would be helpful.
Dan Janki: Yes, certainly. Duane, thank you for the question. Year-to-date, we're on track to where we were last year on similar earnings. And that's even with actually a headwind as it relates to the booking curve. As we talked about over the summer, that spring and summer that compressed. It's starting to expand. We haven't yet gotten all that back. We expect more of that to materialize here in the fourth quarter. And the underlying improvement to offset that is coming out of working capital. We built up, you know, a lot of just I won't call it inefficiencies, but excesses. We are rebuilding the airline, and now's our time as we drive efficiency to work that off, and you're seeing that in working capital.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then maybe, Glen, for my follow-up. One of the questions we got from a general this morning was, can you put the corporate recovery in context, excluding any benefit from a CrowdStrike comp? In other words, are we fully back? How would you put this corporate recovery in context? Thank you.
Glen Hauenstein: Yes. I think we're beyond where the CrowdStrike impact was from last year, and we're seeing similar results to what we disclosed in the third-quarter earnings moving to the 4Q. And I'd just remind you and other people on the call that while corporate revenues have recovered to 2019 levels and are slightly above those now, the number of passengers that are booking because fares are higher are still in the high seventies. We think as business continues to normalize, we have a lot of runway to continue to expand the corporate demand.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live.
Tom Fitzgerald: Hi, everyone. Thanks very much for the time. I was wondering if you could unpack the improvements you're seeing in the domestic market and how much that might be unique to you just given your exposure to higher-income households?
Glen Hauenstein: Well, certainly, I think their exposure to higher household income cohort has enhanced our relative position versus carriers that are catering to a more stressed lower to middle-income environment. So we'll see as everybody else reports. I can only speak for Delta Air Lines, and the strength that we've seen is continuing to accelerate as we head into the fourth quarter.
Tom Fitzgerald: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just kind of on the same topic, I was wondering if you could unpack some of the mix shift benefit that you might see as we move into 2026 and 2027, as you take on delivery of new aircraft? Thanks again for the time.
Glen Hauenstein: We continue to invest in the higher-end products, whether or not that's opening up new Delta One lounges or check-in areas. And so as we continue to take delivery, they come with a higher mix of premium products. And if you look next year, well, we haven't given any guidance, but most of our growth, if not almost all of it, will be in the premium sectors.
Matthew: Your next question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.
Catherine O'Brien: Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Maybe one for Dan. You know, not asking for 2026 guidance, but this year, your unit cost performance benefited from efficiency gains and growing into your workforce and your fleet and your airport assets. I guess, what inning are we in that efficiency growth, and are there further tailwinds from this into next year?
Dan Janki: Yeah. We talked a bunch about this at the Investor Day last November, and all those trends are intact. Certainly, we are still in the early to middle innings where we believe over the term we can continue to drive efficiency by growing into that workforce, continue to get growth in the generational airports that we've built that are actually in our run rate. The investment that we've made in fleet, as we get scale and efficiency as we continue on the fleet renewal. And then the other element that we talked about is just the role of technology. And that it will have in regards to enabling our workforce and giving them tools and transparency to just be more efficient. And we think that is certainly in the very, very early innings of the unlock, and we have years of that in front of us.
Catherine O'Brien: Yeah. That's great. And then my second one is actually a bit of a follow-up to Tom's. I wanted to dig in a bit on domestic main cabin turning positive specifically. Can you give a little more color there? I know one driver of that is that domestic main cabin seats for Delta Air Lines are down year-over-year. Can you tell us by how much? And then maybe the converse of that, I know back in August when I was in Atlanta, we spoke about how you're adding you're doing some retrofits to add incremental Delta Comfort seats this year. What is this year's retrofits do for premium seat mix into next year? I know you said most of next year's growth driven by premium seats, but just wondering specifically how the retrofits contribute to that as well. Thanks so much.
Glen Hauenstein: Right. Certainly, as we continue to the premiumization, if you will, of the Delta Air Lines ecosystem is really dependent on two things. One is the retrofits, which you mentioned, which accounts for probably about 25% to 30% of the incremental premium seats. Then new aircraft deliveries that are continuing to come with a higher mix of premium as they roll out of the factory. Both those contributing to the continuation of improving the experience for our customers. And then lastly, on main cabin demand, we have seen an inflection. Our main cabin seats are down slightly. They're not down significantly from last year. So relatively flat. What we have seen is a rationalization of capacity in many of our hubs. As a matter of fact, if you look forward through November, capacity in almost all of our hubs is down year-over-year from competitive sets. This is allowing us to rationalize the seats that are there and continue to drive unit revenues up.
Catherine O'Brien: Very helpful. Thank you.
Matthew: Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.
Jamie Baker: So for Glen, premium revenue growth exceeded that of the main cabin by 13 points. That's obviously a new record. And I guess my question is a bit of a follow-up to Katie's. I mean, obviously, the outcome is driven by weakness in oil and consumer, but can you drill down a bit deeper into actual changes in consumer behavior? So if, for example, if you looked at SkyMiles member behavior, how much premium growth is driven by your more affluent members taking more trips, versus maybe less affluent flyers trading up to a better experience? You know, there seem to be so many moving pieces to explain the 9% rise in premium, the 4% contraction in the main cabin. We obviously know the outcome is great, but any further comment on the specific building blocks would be helpful.
Glen Hauenstein: Well, Jamie, I think you know, we've been outlining this for many years that we think that premium still has a long runway. And, you know, as you know, following this industry for a long time, we were not selling premium seats ten or fifteen years ago. We were giving them away. And, you know, the reengineering of the whole purchase process where we made them much more affordable and much more attainable has allowed people to buy up into those categories. And, you know, we've always said that we aren't really at the end state in terms of getting the distribution systems where we need them to be. To make sure that those products are being displayed to consumers or agencies in a way that they need to be, and that's been a long journey too. So, yes, it's been a transformation, and, yes, all of the above are true that people are attaching to these products, and then their repeat rate on them is incredibly high. And in previous calls, I've equated it to the car that you drive today. Is it better than the first car you had? The answer is probably yes, and you don't see many people going back to cars that are worse. And I think once people get used to traveling in a certain product, whether it's Comfort Plus, Delta Premium Select, or Delta One, they tend not to go back. Their retention rate's in the mid-eighties. And so the intent to repurchase is very high, continuing to expand the availability of the products, the price points on the products, and this is a journey, a long journey we're on. So I think it's a great question. And I think we see that there are many, many more opportunities in premium in the coming years.
Dan Janki: Appreciate it. So, Jamie, if I could add to that. A couple of things. There's also you need to look at the geographies. Right? Look at the investment we've made in LA and Boston and New York, you know, the coastal that's in Seattle. That's where a considerable amount of premium lives. And Delta Air Lines historically wasn't as big in those markets as we are now. Not only have we moved in there, but we've also built generational experiences, you know, through the airports, the Delta One lounges. Corporate travel is our bread and butter. We are the very best at it. Very we're best serving it. Corporate travel is premium. Right? And so, you know, all of these things go in, as you said in your question, there's a lot to that. But we see a considerable amount of continued momentum forward in premium. And, you know, the question we get from customers all the time is can we get more?
Jamie Baker: Well, thanks for that, gentlemen. And that actually leads to my follow-up. What does the Venn diagram look like between premium and corporate? So if JPMorgan buys me a main cabin ticket to Miami, that's clearly gonna show up as corporate for you. You know, it's gonna be on our discount. But if JPMorgan buys me Delta One to Los Angeles, I guess that counts as both corporate and premium.
Glen Hauenstein: Yes.
Jamie Baker: Of course, could you quantify sort of what that overlap is? What percentage of premium is corporate?
Glen Hauenstein: Yeah. It's probably 30% to 40%. We can get the exact number.
Jamie Baker: Okay. Good. More and more and more and more, and I think this is the exciting part for us. If you think about one of the issues we had many years back, the difference in yields on corporate and high-yield leisure were very, very different. And so it was a steep cliff if you weren't filling your planes with corporate. On what you had to fill them with. And now those adverts, in some cases, corporate personal leisure is higher than corporate these days. So it's given us a really nice ability to manage. And one of the issues we've had with our team that we've been working on is sometimes we run out of seats for corporate, and we have to go and put more seats in the market because corporate was getting squeezed out by higher-yielding leisure.
Jamie Baker: Excellent. And if I could just squeeze in a third follow-up, just because you brought that point up. You had said 2027 was the year in which premium would overtake the main cabin. Is there any reason we wouldn't see that occur in a quarter or two next year?
Glen Hauenstein: Oh, I think you will.
Jamie Baker: Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.
Glen Hauenstein: Thank you, Jamie.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.
Conor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Glen, you had a chance to talk about your first car. I think it was the Ram I think you referenced that a couple of times. I remember.
Glen Hauenstein: A regular classic. Maybe weekends. High school.
Conor Cunningham: Maybe we can stick with the premium discussion because there still seems to be a fair underappreciation for what's going on here. I think, out there. So, like, obviously, the revenue growth on premium versus the main cabin has been very, very strong for quite some time. But I was hoping you could talk about the profitability of the segments of the cabin. I think that the I mean, should we look at the gap in just the terms of the growth overall as a good benchmark for the differences in overall contribution? I just it just there seems to be another step function change coming on seat mix. So it just seems like there's a further step function change coming on profitability as well. So if you could just talk about the segments on the profitability side, standpoint, that would be helpful.
Glen Hauenstein: I just think that when you think about what's different and what's changed over the last ten or fifteen years, the premium products used to be loss leaders, and now they're the highest margin products. That's really the headline. And really in descending order of their premium versus their margin. So the best margins are in the most premium products, and you just work your way down. Now we've had some convergence on Delta Premium Select, which has actually been so popular as we've introduced it. That the margins are starting to converge with Delta One, and we're working on separating those back out again. But, you know, really exciting opportunities. These are relatively new products for the airlines. We've only had them, and we've only been selling them. And we've only been selling them in widely available distribution for less than ten years.
Conor Cunningham: Interesting. Great. Maybe on corporate, just to follow-up to Dwayne's question. General. I got I got a similar question as well. Like, it's so I know that there's some CrowdStrike noise within it, but the 8% number is a lot. If you look at, you know, some of the other travel industries out there, they're not calling out a gain like that. So to me, it kind of it seems like you're driving additional share gains or maybe you could just talk about how the overall market is expanding in general and how you're continuing to drive share within it. Thank you.
Glen Hauenstein: Well, first of all, I'd like to call out our sales team. They're the best sales team in the industry. They're doing an amazing job for us. And, clearly, we are continuing to take share on a margin. So, you know, we monitor our share, and then we reconcile it later. But I think, you know, we're seeing mild gains in total share and certainly higher gains in revenue share. But there's a lot of opportunity to as we look forward here is that, you know, corporations are still not traveling in the volumes they did pre-pandemic. And so as that travel continues to come back, and I think we could look at third-quarter sales and, yeah, take the CrowdStrike out of it. We're still in the double digits.
Dan Janki: I think what I'd add on corporate because I've heard it a couple of times that somehow it might be driven by CrowdStrike. Actually, that 8%, September was higher than eight. It was 9%. Right. And that didn't have CrowdStrike, so I get it. So I think that's the there's real momentum here with corporate. It's across all the segments. This hasn't anything to do with the technology outage.
Glen Hauenstein: Yeah. One other thing, Conor, I'd add. Is corporate suspended travel in the early part of the year. So there is also what was some level of pent-up demand to get back out, and I don't think you can underestimate that. I don't see that stopping, by the way, because, you know, our outlook when we ask the corporates that are gonna continue to grow. But there was clearly for four or five months, this spring, we were not seeing any corporate growth, and then they all they all got back on the road together at the same time. So yeah. Awesome. Thank you. Sales up into this week are staying at or above the numbers we just posted with them.
Conor Cunningham: Awesome. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.
Andrew Didora: Good morning, everyone. Maybe, Glen, maybe switching gears a little bit and speaking about Atlantic here. Obviously, RASM down 7% in 3Q. I know you spoke about a step function change happening here, but I doubt you're expecting to get back to flat in 4Q. But maybe could you speak to how Atlantic performed throughout 3Q and kind of what you need to see in order for that entity to climb back to flat unit revenue?
Glen Hauenstein: Well, yeah, I think third quarter was clearly disappointing, and I think it was a host of things. Some of it might have been our fault in terms of where we thought the booking curve would be and how we held out for higher fares, and next year, we're gonna be much more aggressive in building a solid book earlier in the year. I think the other thing was the booking as Ed refers to it as the spring swoon. When the spring swoon was happening and everybody got a little nervous when tariffs were introduced, that was the booking window for the latter part of the summer. So that had some impact on the main cabin as well. And then finally, I think we've discussed earlier is that given that the cohort on the premium products is really it's in their sixties. That the fall has become a relatively more attractive period than the summer in terms of high-yield leisure. So it's a combination of all three. So we're gonna attack it multifaceted next year. I think, you know, we're gonna hopefully not have any kind of swoon in the whole demand set. We're going to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of the main cabin and filling up those cabins earlier in the booking curve. And then we're gonna adjust our capacity to make sure that we're not creating the church for Easter Sunday in July and August, gonna flatten that out more for the summer season to have a better distribution of capacity.
Andrew Didora: That's interesting. Thank you. And then, Glen, since you spoke about kind of margins within the cabin, curious if you'd be willing to rank your geographies by margin performance thus far in 2025 and, you know, maybe how you expect that change, if at all, heading into 4Q in 2026. Thank you.
Glen Hauenstein: Historically, we had a domestic premium and an international, and I'm not gonna go beyond the international as a whole. But this year, they're relatively similar. They've converged on each other, and we're gonna have a race. We've got our domestic for '26. Our domestic improvement versus our international improvement, and we'll we're gonna compete them against each other and see which one can generate the higher returns next year.
Andrew Didora: Great. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.
Mike Linenberg: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, Glen, back to the government shutdown. If you sort of think back to 2018, 2019, when did it start to bite? I mean, we're day nine in, and what can you recall what that financial impact was to Delta Air Lines?
Glen Hauenstein: We said at the time it was a little bit less than about a million dollars a day. Now it's less than a million dollars a day for various reasons. One is that DCA travel was off even before. So, you know, DCA has not been a real driver in terms of revenue improvement this year. So less than a million dollars a day in now, and it was about a million dollars a day previously.
Mike Linenberg: Great. And then just a second quick one here. Thought it was interesting you called out Austin in your release. Clearly, non-hub flying historically. Non-hub flying tended to be lower margin RASM dilutive. What's changed? What makes the Delta Air Lines product Oh, maybe I'm answering the question. I'll leave it to you. Why is it different this time? Thank you.
Glen Hauenstein: I think, you know, we used to look at the airline at a route level. But that wasn't really thinking about what's inside the minds of customers. And, you know, what makes customers choose Delta Air Lines over a different carrier? And I think the answer is relevance. Right? If we don't if we're not relevant, we cannot acquire the SkyMiles. We cannot acquire the frequent flyer, the credit cards. And so the ecosystem has to have relevance. And that's why it's important for us to have focused cities. Yeah. And those focused cities have been quite profitable for us. You know, sometimes exceeding that of the hubs. And so we're continuing to invest in focus cities. You know, we don't have a lot of them, but the ones we do have, we've chosen for specific reasons. And let's say Austin, we've chosen because we don't have a Texas hub. Everybody else who everybody else has a Texas hub except Delta Air Lines. As you know, Texas is a in and of itself, is a huge revenue market. So, you know, it's seeing those opportunities, looking at the demographics, looking at the GDP of generation for these cities and saying, where do we need to have a relevant offer so that people will join our SkyMiles program. They will join our and get our credit cards, and we can produce relevance.
Mike Linenberg: Very good. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys, and thank you for the time. I want to maybe follow-up on the Atlantic comments. So two questions there. Know, how do we think about Atlantic capacity next year? Glen, you mentioned more evenly dispersed I guess, how are you thinking about that? And maybe secondly, given your competitor just announced some new additions, how are you thinking about competitive capacity, your own network planning, as well as the A330, A350?
Glen Hauenstein: Well, I think our product is best in class in the Transatlantic. We continue to monitor our relative performance in terms of net promoter scores, and I think it's leading right now, and it's going to get much better as we continue to deliver new airplanes with Delta One suites and with the enhanced Delta Premium Select and larger Delta Comfort Plus cabin. So I'm really excited about the product that we're putting in the market. We've chosen not to fly narrow bodies in the Transatlantic because of product and brand issues. And so we're not gonna go in that direction. But next year's capacity, I don't know. I mean, I think it's early in the game. Not everybody's announced what they're gonna fly. And, usually, everybody announces what they're gonna fly, not what they're not going to fly. And so that usually follows after what we're going to fly next year. So we'll see how it all shakes out. I think it's gonna be probably low single digits. As far as our summer, we'll be probably in a very, very low single digits if growth at all and very peak months of July and August. With a slightly higher shoulder season, which is becoming more peaky.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.
Savi Syth: Hey. Good morning. I wonder if you could share what you're seeing on the Latin America side, perhaps broken out by near international and long haul.
Glen Hauenstein: Latin America long haul, short haul. Yeah. Long haul has been very solid for us. It comes into season in the winter. It's looking for a very good strong winter season. Short haul has been a mixed bag. The Caribbean is doing well. Mexican beach is under a little pressure, but all still very profitable for us. So continuing to make investments in those regions.
Savi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might, on the management side, Dan Community have Do you expect 2026 to be above or below in terms of heavy maintenance events? And setting that aside, like, what are you seeing in terms of inflation on maintenance and parts? Is that getting better?
Dan Janki: Savi, we apologize. We weren't able to hear you clearly on this side. Know it related to 2026, but I couldn't hear the context of the question. Could you repeat it?
Savi Syth: Yeah. Sorry about that. I was just on the maintenance side, do you expect 2026 to have more or less heavy maintenance events? And beyond the events, just on inflation, just what are you seeing on the maintenance and parts? I mean, is there is that improving from kinda heavy levels?
Dan Janki: Yeah. We're still in the early stages of our planning for 2026, so we haven't worked through all our capacity and maintenance. More to come on that as we work through the fall here. As it relates to inflation, yes, you know, I think that's still one part of the supply chain. Both as it relates to material availability to repair, components, all those have had inflation above the normal. They're coming more in line as the industry continues to get better, but it's got a long ways to go. We've kinda said that that part of the supply chain is multiyear in nature as it relates to the opportunities in front of it. Any aspect of it, can look at the turn times and performance are still not at levels that we experienced in that seventeen, eighteen, perspective. And as those come more in line, get healthier, you're gonna see greater efficiency out of that.
Savi Syth: Understood. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.
Scott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So the fourth-quarter earnings guidance is basically the same as Q3 earnings. And we've never really seen that before. I guess, you exclude CrowdStrike last year. I guess I'm trying to understand, do you think this is just the new seasonality that makes Q4 a lot stronger? Or would you say maybe that you under-earned in Q3, and maybe it's some of both? I'm thinking the implications for how to think about next year would be different based on how you think about that dynamic.
Glen Hauenstein: Yeah. Fourth quarter it's actually at or slightly better than the third quarter. And I think it's being driven by strong premium demands and corporate travel in season. So we have a nice long season. If you remember last year, we had the election, and in the October period, we had the country kind of froze right before the election, and unlocked a little bit after the election, but we had that period also have, you know, some favorability in terms of the calendar. So I think the fourth quarter is, as long as business is traveling, is a very strong quarter for us. And I think in the third quarter, particularly in the Transatlantic, we are going to strive to do better in next year's third quarter because we think we have some opportunity should we have to re if we had to replay that to improve our results on the margin.
Scott Group: Okay. So maybe some of both. And then about a point of the revenue growth in Q3 was from MRO, maybe a little help from cargo. Is that sort of sustainable into Q4? And going forward, that MRO strength?
Dan Janki: The MRO over the long term, yes. You're gonna see it. You won't see it every quarter at 60% plus. I'd say both the second and third quarters were quite strong as it related to MRO. For the year, you think of it more in that 20% to 30% range. But we would like to see many years of MRO growth well above the growth of the core airline. And being double-digit. But you won't see it at those levels. You'll see much actually, I think as you fourth quarter, it's probably closer to flat year-over-year. And on cargo, great third quarter. And a shout out to our cargo team. I think they did a fabulous job. We have seen some I'd say, choppiness as we enter the fourth quarter, and we'll see how the final result is. But I wouldn't expect that the 19% would be sustainable into 4Q. It's probably gonna come down from there. And we'll see if it still probably grows in the cargo.
Scott Group: You, guys. Very helpful.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.
Ravi Shanker: Great. Good morning, everyone. Glen, maybe a couple of follow-ups to your earlier comments, kind of specifically focused on 1Q. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about 1Q network planning just given all the continual noise that continues to be out there? And also what happened last year with the kind of close-in weakness and corporate and everything else? Are you treating last year as a one-off? Or are you kind of being more cautious going into next year because of that?
Glen Hauenstein: I think we're going to head into 1Q the same way we're exiting April, which is with a very strong backdrop. And, you know, the quarter we know the most about is the quarter we're in, and the quarter we know the least about is the fourth quarter of next year. But as the first quarter comes into focus, the demand is looking quite robust. And so let's hope that that spring swoon doesn't occur again next year.
Ravi Shanker: Understood. And just on that topic of 1Q and get focusing on Transatlantic, you guys have been talking about that shoulder season strength for some time now clearly manifesting right now. Last year in December, you said that 1Q of 25 in Transatlantic was setting up for one of the strongest years you've ever seen. And part of that was driven by a favorable US dollar. The dollar is not as favorable right now. But are you from what you can see right now, do you see European strength continuing into 1Q 26 similar to what you saw coming into this?
Glen Hauenstein: Yes.
Ravi Shanker: Easy enough. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.
Brandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe this one's for Ed or Dan, but you guys think, in your prepared comments talked about your long-term goals of margin improvement. I think everyone would agree on this call that airline stocks could be viewed pretty cheap, but maybe margin growth would really be welcomed for investors. So I guess in that context, what is in your control here as you look into 2026? I'm not necessarily looking for guidance, but does it just have to be a market that's growing capacity a lot less than we have in the past few years? Or it all these things that we're talking about on the commercial side that just gain more momentum? And what can you do on the cost side as well? I think Dan was just hinting at efficiencies there too. Thank you.
Dan Janki: Yeah. No. Cool. You know, I think I'd point you back Thanks for the question. To a lot that we talked about last November. There were a lot of things in there that we talked about that were Delta Air Lines specific as it related to things that are in our control as we look forward and we want to drive. We run the company for margins. We want to drive margins up into the mid-teens. As we laid out. And we feel that the playbook and strategies and priorities in front of us enable us to do that. Starts with those growing up high-margin, revenue streams faster than the core, premiums at the core of that. We talked about premium seats. Growing. Main cabin outpacing the main cabin. So you have more product out there continue to grow the Amex relationship and loyalty faster. So those are things that help you as it relates to the top line, the fleet renewal, supports that. And then you look at the things that we want to do that and still drive good cost performance of low single digit. And, again, it goes back to the growing into the airports, that are already in our run rate. It goes into the fleet actions that we've been growing and simplifying the fleet and getting scale out of it. Associated with it. And then long term continue to grow in get more efficiency, out of not only our workforce, but the entire supply base but also the benefits that technology bring to it. So we want a steady march over time of doing that. Now, certainly, the industry backdrop is we could be beneficial to that. Supply and demand stay in balance. There's real opportunity for that also. To support additional margin growth excess of the things that are Delta Air Lines specific and controlled.
Brandon Oglenski: Well, and just maybe as a really quick follow-up, I think you guys said co-brand spend was up 12%. I might be off on that, but you talk to some of the loyalty drivers right now and how sustainable it is? Looking into next year?
Glen Hauenstein: Well, I think it's been driven by two things. One is the premiumization of the card itself. So we've been acquiring a record number of premium cardholders. And their spend is multiple of what our base member card spend is. So while you look at the total acquisition numbers and say, I think this is our seventh year of a million or more acquisitions, that the mix of those acquisitions is skewing higher and higher in terms of getting reaching a more premium audience. And those customers have better credit scores, so they get approved more often and they spend more on their cards. So that's been really one of the key drivers for us is not only in the total volume, but the number of premium cards we've been able to acquire. And that's driven versus our 2x versus growth versus total card spend. And that's been year after year that we've been able to do that. And looking to continue to do that through '26. And as the more attractive and the more if you think about the question that was preceded about why Austin or why Raleigh? Well, these are high-income growth areas. These are places that we've acquired a lot of cards in. And trying to understand the interaction between the airline and the card and how to maximize both of those together as opposed to just looking at an individual route.
Brandon Oglenski: Thank you, Glen. Thanks, Dan.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is live.
Tom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Wanted to see if you could give maybe a little bit of additional sense of the you know, looking at 26, you know, you're saying that you'll be in line with the multiyear view. So, let's say, 10% earnings growth, something like that. Do you assume that you get to revenue growth, low single-digit revenue growth, some kind of revenue growth in the main cabin? Or should we think about this where you really get there with the good visibility you have on the premium and card and other things? And that's you know, you kinda get to that multiyear growth without a meaningful, swing up in the main cabin.
Glen Hauenstein: Well, I think we've already seen an inflection in the main cabin, which is very exciting to us. And, you know, the trends that we see today are probably the trends that are gonna carry us at least through the beginning part of 2026. So I would expect that the main cabin does have improvement as part of our base as part of our base revenue assumptions for '26. And on top of that, the continued growth of the premium products and the card spend as well. So yeah, I'm excited about the fact that we have finally inflected in the main cabin.
Tom Wadewitz: Okay. But you wouldn't necessarily see that as upside. That's kind of assumed within getting to what, you know, what the multiyear is.
Glen Hauenstein: We haven't given any guidance on that yet. So Yeah. Stay tuned.
Tom Wadewitz: Okay. No. I appreciate that. That's fair enough. The improvement in the main cabin, do you think that that's, like, you know, I think the consumer and especially kinda lower-end consumer is you know, it's unclear whether how optimistic you should be. So do you think that what you've seen in the sales trend that's been favorable is that consumers flying more? Do you think it's just Delta Air Lines' share in kind of industry capacity rationalization that's been beneficial? Or what do you think the kind of bigger driver would be of that improvement you see in 4Q and carrying into '26?
Glen Hauenstein: At the low end of the industry, there's been a lot of seats removed. And that's allowed us to get a footing on fares. I think when you think about the financial performance of the carriers that are catering to the lower-income customers have not been good. Know, someone had to declare bankruptcy. And know, it's the restructurings that they're going through and having to get higher fares. They can't they need they need more money to survive. And so, you know, we had one of our competitors say something, but it's just math. Well, it is just math. That's it. They have to get their fares higher. In terms of and that helps us get a footing on our main cabin as well.
Julie Stewart: Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question.
Matthew: Certainly. Your last question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.
David Vernon: Good morning team and thanks for fitting me in here. So Glen, maybe just a quick micro question for you in terms of the competitive capacity being down in Delta Air Lines hubs year-over-year. I'm wondering if you're seeing any kind of difference in domestic revenue trends in your hubs versus some of the point-to-point leisure markets? I'm trying to get a lot of questions about whether kinda what you're seeing in the main cabin is gonna be an industry-wide thing or more of a Delta Air Lines specific thing.
Glen Hauenstein: Well, we have three categories. We have coastal gateways, we have core hubs, and then we have focus cities. And they've all been behaving well. I'd say the biggest improvements have been in the coastal cities where we've seen a big uptick, and these are also the biggest and wealthiest cities in the country, the New York, the LAs, the Boston, Seattle. Where corporate travel is significantly improving year-over-year and our share is improving. So that's really been a big driver of it. And the hubs have been performing very, very well. And our focus cities, the ones that we're investing in are as expected. So yeah, I think it's a broad brush improvement from where we were just, you know, ninety days ago.
David Vernon: Excellent. Thanks for that. And then maybe just if we kinda step back for a second, coming back to the commentary around earnings consistent with a long-term financial framework. You know, given the weakness and the know, the weirdness of, frankly, of 2025 with the second-quarter slowdown, some of the irregular ops days. I mean, if we don't have something like that repeat is there any reason to think that we shouldn't be at the upper end of the framework you guys have laid out in past. I'm just thinking just the comps are just gonna be so much easier in for a big part of next year that maybe we shouldn't be thinking that I'm wondering if there's a reason we shouldn't be thinking it would be at the higher end of your longer-term financial framework.
Ed Bastian: Hi, David. This is Ed. I'll take that. We haven't given 26 specific insights yet nor have we completed our planning process, so we'll probably be better equipped to talk about that towards the end of this year or early next year. But no question, we saw some pretty strong headwinds that came quite abruptly hit us in late January, early February. You know, we had the aircraft incidents which certainly hurt revenue growth in some important markets. Had a lot of the trade uncertainties while consumer confidence plummeting. And to the point where Delta Air Lines, as you recall, we wound up pulling our guide. There was so much uncertainty for a short period of time. So no question if we have some tailwinds as we look forward into the New Year. And if today's environment projects into '26, I think '20 can be a really strong year.
David Vernon: That's very helpful. Thank you very much for the time.
Julie Stewart: Alright, Matthew. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.
Tim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, as we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if you wouldn't mind please, describing how best to enter into the call queue and the process for one follow-up, please.
Matthew: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. And once again, everyone, if you have any questions or comments, please press star then 1 on your phone. Please hold while we poll for questions. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs. Your line is live.
Leslie Josephs: Hi, everyone. We've seen Amex, Chase, and some others raise credit card fees. Just wondering if you see any pushback from customers in terms of acquisitions on your end, if you think that credit card annual fees at least can keep going up. And then my second question, also seeing really long upgrade lists, which I guess would be good for you guys because you have a lot of elites. Not just on your airline, but others. And curious how you're managing that and if the percentage of paid seats in premium has gone up since the last time you've updated everybody. Thanks.
Glen Hauenstein: Card fees, but we also injected a lot of value for customers, and we had a record acquisition this year. And so very pleased with the results. I can't really comment on the results of Amex or Chase. But I would say as long as you're providing more value to the customers, it seems like a pretty safe bet that there's gonna be strong demand for those premium products across the spectrum. And in terms of our standby list, yes, there's a long standby list, and we have a lot of premium customers. And that's one of the reasons we've expanded our Comfort Plus offerings because our most elite customers are allowed to upgrade into those products at the time of booking. And we didn't have enough of those. If you look across the spectrum, we were generally sold out of Comfort Plus early in the booking curve and now being able to increase that so we can accommodate more of our most premium customers with premium offerings at the time of booking.
Leslie Josephs: Okay.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.
Mary Schlangenstein: Hi. Good morning. In your forecast for Transatlantic travel, I'm wondering if you still expect that to be mostly driven by US point of sale do you see a rebound from non-US based customers?
Glen Hauenstein: You know, it's always been US point of sale, rather. And so the question is how US point of sale will it be? Know, and our point of sale revenue on a revenue we're approaching 80% US point of origin. So yes. We hope that there's going to be more. The dollar, of course, has strengthened. That makes coming to America more of a bargain for customers. And so, hopefully, we see that translate into a little bit higher European point of sale. But we are mostly a US point of origin-driven company.
Mary Schlangenstein: And what are some of the other factors that are ongoing that you see constricting non-US point of sale? Is it still some of the, like, concerns over immigration policies, things like that?
Glen Hauenstein: There's clearly safety concerns. There's a whole host of concerns of travel to the US, but I think, you know, we still have a great product here, and we have great cities, and we have people with relatives and friends and family. And so there's gonna be demand. The question is how much demand? And the good news for us is we're not totally dependent on that. It's not our core business. But I would expect, hopefully, that next year is a little bit better than this year for European point of sale. For nothing else is that the appreciation of the euro has made European fares look relatively more attractive.
Ed Bastian: And, Mary, this is Ed. You know, the conversation, it's also on the margins. Right? It isn't as if Europeans stopped traveling. They're still traveling at large numbers. The numbers may be down. 5%, 7% in some of the markets. You know, we're long-term, think our business model is very healthy for global expansion, and you're gonna continue to see us pursue that.
Mary Schlangenstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Tim Mapes: Thanks, Mary, and congratulations. Matthew, let's squeeze one more in, please.
Matthew: Certainly. Your last question is coming from Niraj Chokshi from New York Times. Your line is live.
Niraj Chokshi: Hey. Thank you. I was just curious. You know, there's some talk about the industry sort of bifurcating, you know, Delta Air Lines and United on one side doing very well and then sort of the rest. And, you know, I guess, do you agree with that assessment? And then if so, is it structural? Is it an industry phase? Just sort of curious to get your sort of sense of what's happening.
Ed Bastian: It's clearly happening. If you look at the results this quarter, as I mentioned on CNBC this morning, we expect 60% of the overall industry profits to be driven by Delta Air Lines. Expect the rest of it probably to be driven by United. Largely. And then you have everybody else, and this is not a new phenomenon. This has been happening really since COVID hit over the last four or five years. Know, there's a lot about the industry fundamentals that have changed. That we at Delta Air Lines are driving a much higher level of quality experience, whether it's reliability, whether it's the product and services that we offer, whether it's the partners we're bringing to the table, whether it's the expansion internationally. And if you are in a category that is, you know, seen as more of a commodity, purchase. That they're having a very difficult time. You know, their cost structures have increased. As labor costs have gone up. Been very difficult to get airplanes to get supply growth, those lower-end models depend on high growth. And there's a lot of congestion in the US marketplace in terms of the sky. So I think the bifurcation you're seeing is gonna continue. And eventually, there'll need to be rationalization to enable the lower end of the price spectrum to continue to sustain itself, to be able to continue to attract capital. And I think we're seeing this all play out right in front of our eyes.
Niraj Chokshi: Thank you.
Tim Mapes: Matthew, that will wrap this up, please.
Matthew: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.

Original transcript:
Matthew: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Delta Air Lines September Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your coordinator. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode until we conduct a question and answer session following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. If you have any questions or comments during the presentation, you may press 1 on your phone to enter the question queue at any time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Stewart, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.
Julie Stewart: Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the September 2025 earnings call. Joining us today from Atlanta are our CEO, Ed Bastian, our President, Glen Hauenstein, and our CFO, Dan Janki. Ed will open the call with an overview of Delta Air Lines' performance and strategy, Glen will provide an update on the revenue environment, and Dan will discuss costs and our balance sheet. After the prepared remarks, we'll take analyst questions. We ask you to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so we can get to as many of you as possible. After the analyst Q&A, we will move to our media questions. As a reminder, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may cause such differences are described in Delta Air Lines' SEC filings. We'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and all results exclude special items unless otherwise noted. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ed.
Ed Bastian: Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. This quarter's results reinforce that Delta Air Lines' competitive advantages and differentiation have never been more evident. In September, Delta Air Lines' revenue growth and earnings came in at the top end of our expectations, delivering performance that we anticipate will lead the industry across all key financial measures. Revenue grew 4%, led by premium, corporate, and loyalty, reflecting the power of Delta Air Lines' brand, the financial strength of our customer base, and improving industry fundamentals. We reported pretax income of $1.5 billion and earnings of $1.71 per share, an 11.2% operating margin. Free cash was $830 million, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to $2.8 billion. We generated a return on invested capital of 13%, five points above our cost of capital in the top half of the S&P 500. Operationally, Delta Air Lines once again led the industry on reliability and customer experience. Through a busy summer, our teams delivered for our customers, and I want to thank them for their outstanding work and dedication. Professionalism and care create the trust consumers have in the Delta Air Lines brand. Sharing success with our people is core to our culture. We've accrued nearly $1 billion year-to-date towards next February's profit sharing because when Delta Air Lines succeeds, so should our people. I also want to recognize the essential aviation work of the controllers, TSA officers, federal air marshals, and many others who are keeping our system safe and secure during the ongoing government shutdown. Thank you for your professionalism and your commitment to the traveling public. We're hopeful that Congress will act to reopen the government as soon as possible. Now turning to our outlook, fundamentals are improving, and the positive momentum is continuing. Since July, travel demand has strengthened, led by a rebound in business travel, which was up high single digits in the quarter. The US economy remains on solid footing, and our customer base is financially strong. Rising preference for premium products and services, SkyMiles membership is expanding, particularly among younger consumers, and engagement is strong across all cohorts. Spending on the Delta Air Lines Amex co-brand card is up double digits year-to-date, with a recent acceleration in travel and entertainment that mirrors the improvement that we're seeing in bookings. Premium revenue growth remains robust. The main cabin trends are improving. Structural change has taken hold across the industry. As unprofitable flying is rationalized, and carriers not earning their cost of capital adjust strategies to prioritize returns. Against this backdrop, we expect to deliver a double-digit operating margin again in December, with earnings comparable to what we earned in September. This would be at or above our all-time fourth-quarter earnings performance. This brings our outlook for full-year earnings to approximately $6 per share, which is in the upper half of our July guidance range. Free cash generation remains a key differentiator for Delta Air Lines, and we are updating our full-year outlook to $3.5 billion to $4 billion, growing our cash generation over last year and consistent with our long-term framework as we build a fortress balance sheet. At the heart of our position of industry leadership is a relentless focus on elevating the customer experience. We're investing across every phase of the journey to make travel with Delta Air Lines more seamless, personalized, and premium, growing our value proposition to customers. On the ground, we're harvesting the benefits of generational investments in our airport infrastructure. This includes upgraded airport facilities, modernized sky clubs, and the launch of Delta One lounges in JFK, LAX, Boston, and Seattle. By year-end, Delta One check-in will be available across all of our hubs. We've also partnered with Uber to begin streamlining the airport pickup and drop-off experiences, enhancing convenience from curb to gate. In the air, we're continuing to expand premium seating and enhanced service offerings, ensuring more customers can experience our most elevated products. Digitally, delivering a connected experience for SkyMiles members, with nearly 1,000 aircraft equipped with fast, free Wi-Fi, well more than all of our US competitors combined, our integrated platform is setting the standard for in-flight connectivity and personalization. Exclusive partnerships with American Express, Uber, and most recently, YouTube, extend SkyMiles further into our members' daily activities, deepening engagement and preference for the Delta Air Lines brand beyond the flight. It's all powered by our people, delivering welcomed, elevated, and caring service that reinforces our industry leadership, sustains our durable revenue premium, and underpins our strong financial foundation. In closing, our financial focus remains on profitable growth, margin expansion, and disciplined capital allocation, all aligned with the three to five-year framework that we shared last November. As we enter the final stretch of our centennial year, I'm more optimistic than ever about Delta Air Lines' future. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll hand it over to Glen to discuss our commercial trends and demand, followed by Dan with the financial details.
Glen Hauenstein: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I want to begin by thanking the Delta Air Lines team for their outstanding commitment throughout the busy summer season and to our customers for their continued loyalty to Delta Air Lines. For September, revenue increased 4.1% year-over-year to $15.2 billion, a third-quarter record and ahead of our guidance as momentum built through the quarter. Trends across our business are improving, and customer preference for the Delta Air Lines brand is showing up in our results. Total unit revenue improved by 0.3% over last year. Importantly, domestic unit revenue turned positive, with sequential improvement as the quarter progressed. This was supported by a main cabin inflection as industry supply moderated and demand improved, materializing earlier than our initial expectations. Internationally, profitability across all entities was strong, with premium continuing to bolster results. Corporate sales trended positively throughout the quarter, up 8% over the prior year, with sequential improvement across all sectors. Domestic corporate sales grew double digits, including mid-teens growth in our coastal hubs. We see opportunities for further growth as corporate confidence rebuilds, reinforced by 90% of our most recent corporate survey respondents anticipating that their 2026 travel volumes will increase or remain steady year-over-year. Diverse high-margin revenue streams grew double digits year-over-year and contributed 60% of total revenue. Within that, premium revenue grew 9% with improvement across all products driven by strong demand and consistent investment in premium offerings. Loyalty revenue improved 9%, and travel-adjacent products grew mid-teens as SkyMiles members engaged beyond the flight and throughout our loyalty ecosystem. Cargo revenues increased 19% driven by the Pacific, Maintenance, repair, and overhaul revenue grew more than 60% on higher volumes and timing of shipments. Delta Air Lines' loyalty ecosystem continues to be a powerful driver of enterprise value. Anchored by the attractiveness of the SkyMiles program, a financially healthy, highly engaged member base, and our exclusive co-brand partnership with American Express. Co-brand holders are among our most valuable customers, traveling more often and spending more on Delta Air Lines. While roughly one-third of active SkyMiles members hold a co-brand card today, we have further runway as both engagement and member penetration continue to rise. A key proof point is the sustained momentum on spend growth, which has outpaced other consumer credit cards by 2x over the last few years. During the quarter, spend grew at a double-digit pace, with new card acquisitions up year-over-year and a record mix of customers choosing the premium cards. With that, remuneration from American Express increased 12% over the prior year to $2 billion in the quarter, keeping us on track to deliver over $8 billion this year and advancing towards our long-term goal of $10 billion within the next few years. Turning to the outlook, the environment continues to improve. Over the past six weeks, sales trends have accelerated across all geographies and in every advanced purchase window, positioning Delta Air Lines to close the year from a position of strength. While we are monitoring potential impacts from the US government shutdown, we have not seen a material effect to date. For December, we expect total revenue to grow 2% to 4% year-over-year on top of last year's record performance with solidly profitable unit revenues. Passenger RASM is showing healthy improvement sequentially, reflecting continued strength in domestic and a step-change improvement in the transatlantic, on firmer main cabin trends and corporate demand. At the same time, financial divergence across the industry has never been greater. As carriers prioritize earnings over their cost of capital, eliminate unprofitable flying, competitive capacity in our hubs is down year-over-year, and we expect a very healthy supply-demand balance across the industry into 2026. In closing, I'm very optimistic as we enter the final quarter, building our momentum and positioning Delta Air Lines for continued top-line growth and margin expansion into 2026. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to cover the financials.
Dan Janki: Thank you, Glen, and good morning to everyone. Delta Air Lines' competitive advantages drove another strong quarter as we continue to set the pace for the industry. Our teams are delivering operationally for our customers and driving efficiency. Year-to-date, we are outperforming the industry across on-time performance, completion factor, and net promoter score. Our premium offerings, industry-leading loyalty programs, and elevated experiences we provide across the entire travel journey are driving increased customer preference for flying Delta Air Lines and underpinning our differentiated financial results. In September, we delivered record third-quarter revenue of $15.2 billion with an operating margin of 11.2% and earnings of $1.71 per share. Non-fuel unit cost growth was approximately flat to the prior year, bringing the year-to-date non-fuel unit cost growth to less than 2%, consistent with our low single-digit guidance at the start of the year, even as we've reduced capacity after the summer peak to align with demand. I want to thank the entire Delta Air Lines team for their hard work to achieve these results. Delta Air Lines generated third-quarter operating cash flow of $1.8 billion, and after reinvesting $1.1 billion into the business, we generated free cash flow of $830 million. On our capital structure, we continue to take an opportunistic approach. Last month, we successfully repriced our SkyMiles term loan, reducing the rate by 225 basis points. This demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and the attractiveness of Delta Air Lines' credit. Strong cash generation has enabled debt paydown of nearly $2 billion year-to-date, with gross leverage ending the quarter at 2.4 times. Now turning to the outlook, for December, as Glen shared, we expect revenue growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year with positive unit revenue. On the cost side, disciplined execution supports non-fuel unit cost growth in low single digits in line with our full-year guidance. With that, we expect fourth-quarter earnings of $1.6 to $1.9 per share and an operating margin of 10.5% to 12%. For the full year, this brings earnings per share of approximately $6 in the upper half of our guidance range we provided in July. On free cash flow, we are updating our guidance to $3.5 to $4 billion. This outlook is within our long-term target range and enables us to pay down debt while returning cash to shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: reinvesting where returns are strong, reducing debt, and maintaining our fortress investment-grade balance sheet, which was recently recognized by Fitch with a revised outlook from stable to positive during the quarter. Our investments are focused on the customer experience, as Ed and Glen spoke about, and on driving efficiency through technology and our fleet. We continue to advance our fleet renewal strategy with approximately 40 aircraft deliveries this year and next. These additions drive meaningful value for our customers through expanded premium seating and for our shareholders through increased efficiency and greater scale among our key fleets. Looking into 2026 and beyond, our focus is on profitable growth and delivering long-term financial targets outlined at our Investor Day last November, including earnings growth, durable free cash flow, and debt repayment to drive sustained value for our shareholders. In closing, I want to extend my sincere thanks to the entire Delta Air Lines team for their commitment to one another and to our customers. And with that, I'll turn it back to Julie for Q&A.
Julie Stewart: Thank you, Dan. Matthew, can you please remind the analysts how to enter the call queue and go to our first question from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI?
Matthew: Certainly. Everyone, at this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. Your first question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is live.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Hey. Thank you. Good morning. With respect to the strong improvement in cash flow year-over-year and operating cash flow, can you just expand on the drivers of that improvement? How much of that is just the working capital benefit of maybe the booking curve normalizing versus earlier in the year? Maybe there's dynamics around MRO. Any thoughts you have would be helpful.
Dan Janki: Yes, certainly. Duane, thank you for the question. Year-to-date, we're on track to where we were last year on similar earnings. And that's even with actually a headwind as it relates to the booking curve. As we talked about over the summer, that spring and summer that compressed. It's starting to expand. We haven't yet gotten all that back. We expect more of that to materialize here in the fourth quarter. And the underlying improvement to offset that is coming out of working capital. We built up, you know, a lot of just I won't call it inefficiencies, but excesses. We are rebuilding the airline, and now's our time as we drive efficiency to work that off, and you're seeing that in working capital.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then maybe, Glen, for my follow-up. One of the questions we got from a general this morning was, can you put the corporate recovery in context, excluding any benefit from a CrowdStrike comp? In other words, are we fully back? How would you put this corporate recovery in context? Thank you.
Glen Hauenstein: Yes. I think we're beyond where the CrowdStrike impact was from last year, and we're seeing similar results to what we disclosed in the third-quarter earnings moving to the 4Q. And I'd just remind you and other people on the call that while corporate revenues have recovered to 2019 levels and are slightly above those now, the number of passengers that are booking because fares are higher are still in the high seventies. We think as business continues to normalize, we have a lot of runway to continue to expand the corporate demand.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Fitzgerald from TD Cowen. Your line is live.
Tom Fitzgerald: Hi, everyone. Thanks very much for the time. I was wondering if you could unpack the improvements you're seeing in the domestic market and how much that might be unique to you just given your exposure to higher-income households?
Glen Hauenstein: Well, certainly, I think their exposure to higher household income cohort has enhanced our relative position versus carriers that are catering to a more stressed lower to middle-income environment. So we'll see as everybody else reports. I can only speak for Delta Air Lines, and the strength that we've seen is continuing to accelerate as we head into the fourth quarter.
Tom Fitzgerald: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just kind of on the same topic, I was wondering if you could unpack some of the mix shift benefit that you might see as we move into 2026 and 2027, as you take on delivery of new aircraft? Thanks again for the time.
Glen Hauenstein: We continue to invest in the higher-end products, whether or not that's opening up new Delta One lounges or check-in areas. And so as we continue to take delivery, they come with a higher mix of premium products. And if you look next year, well, we haven't given any guidance, but most of our growth, if not almost all of it, will be in the premium sectors.
Matthew: Your next question is coming from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.
Catherine O'Brien: Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Maybe one for Dan. You know, not asking for 2026 guidance, but this year, your unit cost performance benefited from efficiency gains and growing into your workforce and your fleet and your airport assets. I guess, what inning are we in that efficiency growth, and are there further tailwinds from this into next year?
Dan Janki: Yeah. We talked a bunch about this at the Investor Day last November, and all those trends are intact. Certainly, we are still in the early to middle innings where we believe over the term we can continue to drive efficiency by growing into that workforce, continue to get growth in the generational airports that we've built that are actually in our run rate. The investment that we've made in fleet, as we get scale and efficiency as we continue on the fleet renewal. And then the other element that we talked about is just the role of technology. And that it will have in regards to enabling our workforce and giving them tools and transparency to just be more efficient. And we think that is certainly in the very, very early innings of the unlock, and we have years of that in front of us.
Catherine O'Brien: Yeah. That's great. And then my second one is actually a bit of a follow-up to Tom's. I wanted to dig in a bit on domestic main cabin turning positive specifically. Can you give a little more color there? I know one driver of that is that domestic main cabin seats for Delta Air Lines are down year-over-year. Can you tell us by how much? And then maybe the converse of that, I know back in August when I was in Atlanta, we spoke about how you're adding you're doing some retrofits to add incremental Delta Comfort seats this year. What is this year's retrofits do for premium seat mix into next year? I know you said most of next year's growth driven by premium seats, but just wondering specifically how the retrofits contribute to that as well. Thanks so much.
Glen Hauenstein: Right. Certainly, as we continue to the premiumization, if you will, of the Delta Air Lines ecosystem is really dependent on two things. One is the retrofits, which you mentioned, which accounts for probably about 25% to 30% of the incremental premium seats. Then new aircraft deliveries that are continuing to come with a higher mix of premium as they roll out of the factory. Both those contributing to the continuation of improving the experience for our customers. And then lastly, on main cabin demand, we have seen an inflection. Our main cabin seats are down slightly. They're not down significantly from last year. So relatively flat. What we have seen is a rationalization of capacity in many of our hubs. As a matter of fact, if you look forward through November, capacity in almost all of our hubs is down year-over-year from competitive sets. This is allowing us to rationalize the seats that are there and continue to drive unit revenues up.
Catherine O'Brien: Very helpful. Thank you.
Matthew: Your next question is coming from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is live.
Jamie Baker: So for Glen, premium revenue growth exceeded that of the main cabin by 13 points. That's obviously a new record. And I guess my question is a bit of a follow-up to Katie's. I mean, obviously, the outcome is driven by weakness in oil and consumer, but can you drill down a bit deeper into actual changes in consumer behavior? So if, for example, if you looked at SkyMiles member behavior, how much premium growth is driven by your more affluent members taking more trips, versus maybe less affluent flyers trading up to a better experience? You know, there seem to be so many moving pieces to explain the 9% rise in premium, the 4% contraction in the main cabin. We obviously know the outcome is great, but any further comment on the specific building blocks would be helpful.
Glen Hauenstein: Well, Jamie, I think you know, we've been outlining this for many years that we think that premium still has a long runway. And, you know, as you know, following this industry for a long time, we were not selling premium seats ten or fifteen years ago. We were giving them away. And, you know, the reengineering of the whole purchase process where we made them much more affordable and much more attainable has allowed people to buy up into those categories. And, you know, we've always said that we aren't really at the end state in terms of getting the distribution systems where we need them to be. To make sure that those products are being displayed to consumers or agencies in a way that they need to be, and that's been a long journey too. So, yes, it's been a transformation, and, yes, all of the above are true that people are attaching to these products, and then their repeat rate on them is incredibly high. And in previous calls, I've equated it to the car that you drive today. Is it better than the first car you had? The answer is probably yes, and you don't see many people going back to cars that are worse. And I think once people get used to traveling in a certain product, whether it's Comfort Plus, Delta Premium Select, or Delta One, they tend not to go back. Their retention rate's in the mid-eighties. And so the intent to repurchase is very high, continuing to expand the availability of the products, the price points on the products, and this is a journey, a long journey we're on. So I think it's a great question. And I think we see that there are many, many more opportunities in premium in the coming years.
Dan Janki: Appreciate it. So, Jamie, if I could add to that. A couple of things. There's also you need to look at the geographies. Right? Look at the investment we've made in LA and Boston and New York, you know, the coastal that's in Seattle. That's where a considerable amount of premium lives. And Delta Air Lines historically wasn't as big in those markets as we are now. Not only have we moved in there, but we've also built generational experiences, you know, through the airports, the Delta One lounges. Corporate travel is our bread and butter. We are the very best at it. Very we're best serving it. Corporate travel is premium. Right? And so, you know, all of these things go in, as you said in your question, there's a lot to that. But we see a considerable amount of continued momentum forward in premium. And, you know, the question we get from customers all the time is can we get more?
Jamie Baker: Well, thanks for that, gentlemen. And that actually leads to my follow-up. What does the Venn diagram look like between premium and corporate? So if JPMorgan buys me a main cabin ticket to Miami, that's clearly gonna show up as corporate for you. You know, it's gonna be on our discount. But if JPMorgan buys me Delta One to Los Angeles, I guess that counts as both corporate and premium.
Glen Hauenstein: Yes.
Jamie Baker: Of course, could you quantify sort of what that overlap is? What percentage of premium is corporate?
Glen Hauenstein: Yeah. It's probably 30% to 40%. We can get the exact number.
Jamie Baker: Okay. Good. More and more and more and more, and I think this is the exciting part for us. If you think about one of the issues we had many years back, the difference in yields on corporate and high-yield leisure were very, very different. And so it was a steep cliff if you weren't filling your planes with corporate. On what you had to fill them with. And now those adverts, in some cases, corporate personal leisure is higher than corporate these days. So it's given us a really nice ability to manage. And one of the issues we've had with our team that we've been working on is sometimes we run out of seats for corporate, and we have to go and put more seats in the market because corporate was getting squeezed out by higher-yielding leisure.
Jamie Baker: Excellent. And if I could just squeeze in a third follow-up, just because you brought that point up. You had said 2027 was the year in which premium would overtake the main cabin. Is there any reason we wouldn't see that occur in a quarter or two next year?
Glen Hauenstein: Oh, I think you will.
Jamie Baker: Okay. Thank you very much, everybody.
Glen Hauenstein: Thank you, Jamie.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Your line is live.
Conor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Glen, you had a chance to talk about your first car. I think it was the Ram I think you referenced that a couple of times. I remember.
Glen Hauenstein: A regular classic. Maybe weekends. High school.
Conor Cunningham: Maybe we can stick with the premium discussion because there still seems to be a fair underappreciation for what's going on here. I think, out there. So, like, obviously, the revenue growth on premium versus the main cabin has been very, very strong for quite some time. But I was hoping you could talk about the profitability of the segments of the cabin. I think that the I mean, should we look at the gap in just the terms of the growth overall as a good benchmark for the differences in overall contribution? I just it just there seems to be another step function change coming on seat mix. So it just seems like there's a further step function change coming on profitability as well. So if you could just talk about the segments on the profitability side, standpoint, that would be helpful.
Glen Hauenstein: I just think that when you think about what's different and what's changed over the last ten or fifteen years, the premium products used to be loss leaders, and now they're the highest margin products. That's really the headline. And really in descending order of their premium versus their margin. So the best margins are in the most premium products, and you just work your way down. Now we've had some convergence on Delta Premium Select, which has actually been so popular as we've introduced it. That the margins are starting to converge with Delta One, and we're working on separating those back out again. But, you know, really exciting opportunities. These are relatively new products for the airlines. We've only had them, and we've only been selling them. And we've only been selling them in widely available distribution for less than ten years.
Conor Cunningham: Interesting. Great. Maybe on corporate, just to follow-up to Dwayne's question. General. I got I got a similar question as well. Like, it's so I know that there's some CrowdStrike noise within it, but the 8% number is a lot. If you look at, you know, some of the other travel industries out there, they're not calling out a gain like that. So to me, it kind of it seems like you're driving additional share gains or maybe you could just talk about how the overall market is expanding in general and how you're continuing to drive share within it. Thank you.
Glen Hauenstein: Well, first of all, I'd like to call out our sales team. They're the best sales team in the industry. They're doing an amazing job for us. And, clearly, we are continuing to take share on a margin. So, you know, we monitor our share, and then we reconcile it later. But I think, you know, we're seeing mild gains in total share and certainly higher gains in revenue share. But there's a lot of opportunity to as we look forward here is that, you know, corporations are still not traveling in the volumes they did pre-pandemic. And so as that travel continues to come back, and I think we could look at third-quarter sales and, yeah, take the CrowdStrike out of it. We're still in the double digits.
Dan Janki: I think what I'd add on corporate because I've heard it a couple of times that somehow it might be driven by CrowdStrike. Actually, that 8%, September was higher than eight. It was 9%. Right. And that didn't have CrowdStrike, so I get it. So I think that's the there's real momentum here with corporate. It's across all the segments. This hasn't anything to do with the technology outage.
Glen Hauenstein: Yeah. One other thing, Conor, I'd add. Is corporate suspended travel in the early part of the year. So there is also what was some level of pent-up demand to get back out, and I don't think you can underestimate that. I don't see that stopping, by the way, because, you know, our outlook when we ask the corporates that are gonna continue to grow. But there was clearly for four or five months, this spring, we were not seeing any corporate growth, and then they all they all got back on the road together at the same time. So yeah. Awesome. Thank you. Sales up into this week are staying at or above the numbers we just posted with them.
Conor Cunningham: Awesome. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Your line is live.
Andrew Didora: Good morning, everyone. Maybe, Glen, maybe switching gears a little bit and speaking about Atlantic here. Obviously, RASM down 7% in 3Q. I know you spoke about a step function change happening here, but I doubt you're expecting to get back to flat in 4Q. But maybe could you speak to how Atlantic performed throughout 3Q and kind of what you need to see in order for that entity to climb back to flat unit revenue?
Glen Hauenstein: Well, yeah, I think third quarter was clearly disappointing, and I think it was a host of things. Some of it might have been our fault in terms of where we thought the booking curve would be and how we held out for higher fares, and next year, we're gonna be much more aggressive in building a solid book earlier in the year. I think the other thing was the booking as Ed refers to it as the spring swoon. When the spring swoon was happening and everybody got a little nervous when tariffs were introduced, that was the booking window for the latter part of the summer. So that had some impact on the main cabin as well. And then finally, I think we've discussed earlier is that given that the cohort on the premium products is really it's in their sixties. That the fall has become a relatively more attractive period than the summer in terms of high-yield leisure. So it's a combination of all three. So we're gonna attack it multifaceted next year. I think, you know, we're gonna hopefully not have any kind of swoon in the whole demand set. We're going to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of the main cabin and filling up those cabins earlier in the booking curve. And then we're gonna adjust our capacity to make sure that we're not creating the church for Easter Sunday in July and August, gonna flatten that out more for the summer season to have a better distribution of capacity.
Andrew Didora: That's interesting. Thank you. And then, Glen, since you spoke about kind of margins within the cabin, curious if you'd be willing to rank your geographies by margin performance thus far in 2025 and, you know, maybe how you expect that change, if at all, heading into 4Q in 2026. Thank you.
Glen Hauenstein: Historically, we had a domestic premium and an international, and I'm not gonna go beyond the international as a whole. But this year, they're relatively similar. They've converged on each other, and we're gonna have a race. We've got our domestic for '26. Our domestic improvement versus our international improvement, and we'll we're gonna compete them against each other and see which one can generate the higher returns next year.
Andrew Didora: Great. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.
Mike Linenberg: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, Glen, back to the government shutdown. If you sort of think back to 2018, 2019, when did it start to bite? I mean, we're day nine in, and what can you recall what that financial impact was to Delta Air Lines?
Glen Hauenstein: We said at the time it was a little bit less than about a million dollars a day. Now it's less than a million dollars a day for various reasons. One is that DCA travel was off even before. So, you know, DCA has not been a real driver in terms of revenue improvement this year. So less than a million dollars a day in now, and it was about a million dollars a day previously.
Mike Linenberg: Great. And then just a second quick one here. Thought it was interesting you called out Austin in your release. Clearly, non-hub flying historically. Non-hub flying tended to be lower margin RASM dilutive. What's changed? What makes the Delta Air Lines product Oh, maybe I'm answering the question. I'll leave it to you. Why is it different this time? Thank you.
Glen Hauenstein: I think, you know, we used to look at the airline at a route level. But that wasn't really thinking about what's inside the minds of customers. And, you know, what makes customers choose Delta Air Lines over a different carrier? And I think the answer is relevance. Right? If we don't if we're not relevant, we cannot acquire the SkyMiles. We cannot acquire the frequent flyer, the credit cards. And so the ecosystem has to have relevance. And that's why it's important for us to have focused cities. Yeah. And those focused cities have been quite profitable for us. You know, sometimes exceeding that of the hubs. And so we're continuing to invest in focus cities. You know, we don't have a lot of them, but the ones we do have, we've chosen for specific reasons. And let's say Austin, we've chosen because we don't have a Texas hub. Everybody else who everybody else has a Texas hub except Delta Air Lines. As you know, Texas is a in and of itself, is a huge revenue market. So, you know, it's seeing those opportunities, looking at the demographics, looking at the GDP of generation for these cities and saying, where do we need to have a relevant offer so that people will join our SkyMiles program. They will join our and get our credit cards, and we can produce relevance.
Mike Linenberg: Very good. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Your line is live.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys, and thank you for the time. I want to maybe follow-up on the Atlantic comments. So two questions there. Know, how do we think about Atlantic capacity next year? Glen, you mentioned more evenly dispersed I guess, how are you thinking about that? And maybe secondly, given your competitor just announced some new additions, how are you thinking about competitive capacity, your own network planning, as well as the A330, A350?
Glen Hauenstein: Well, I think our product is best in class in the Transatlantic. We continue to monitor our relative performance in terms of net promoter scores, and I think it's leading right now, and it's going to get much better as we continue to deliver new airplanes with Delta One suites and with the enhanced Delta Premium Select and larger Delta Comfort Plus cabin. So I'm really excited about the product that we're putting in the market. We've chosen not to fly narrow bodies in the Transatlantic because of product and brand issues. And so we're not gonna go in that direction. But next year's capacity, I don't know. I mean, I think it's early in the game. Not everybody's announced what they're gonna fly. And, usually, everybody announces what they're gonna fly, not what they're not going to fly. And so that usually follows after what we're going to fly next year. So we'll see how it all shakes out. I think it's gonna be probably low single digits. As far as our summer, we'll be probably in a very, very low single digits if growth at all and very peak months of July and August. With a slightly higher shoulder season, which is becoming more peaky.
Sheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is live.
Savi Syth: Hey. Good morning. I wonder if you could share what you're seeing on the Latin America side, perhaps broken out by near international and long haul.
Glen Hauenstein: Latin America long haul, short haul. Yeah. Long haul has been very solid for us. It comes into season in the winter. It's looking for a very good strong winter season. Short haul has been a mixed bag. The Caribbean is doing well. Mexican beach is under a little pressure, but all still very profitable for us. So continuing to make investments in those regions.
Savi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might, on the management side, Dan Community have Do you expect 2026 to be above or below in terms of heavy maintenance events? And setting that aside, like, what are you seeing in terms of inflation on maintenance and parts? Is that getting better?
Dan Janki: Savi, we apologize. We weren't able to hear you clearly on this side. Know it related to 2026, but I couldn't hear the context of the question. Could you repeat it?
Savi Syth: Yeah. Sorry about that. I was just on the maintenance side, do you expect 2026 to have more or less heavy maintenance events? And beyond the events, just on inflation, just what are you seeing on the maintenance and parts? I mean, is there is that improving from kinda heavy levels?
Dan Janki: Yeah. We're still in the early stages of our planning for 2026, so we haven't worked through all our capacity and maintenance. More to come on that as we work through the fall here. As it relates to inflation, yes, you know, I think that's still one part of the supply chain. Both as it relates to material availability to repair, components, all those have had inflation above the normal. They're coming more in line as the industry continues to get better, but it's got a long ways to go. We've kinda said that that part of the supply chain is multiyear in nature as it relates to the opportunities in front of it. Any aspect of it, can look at the turn times and performance are still not at levels that we experienced in that seventeen, eighteen, perspective. And as those come more in line, get healthier, you're gonna see greater efficiency out of that.
Savi Syth: Understood. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is live.
Scott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. So the fourth-quarter earnings guidance is basically the same as Q3 earnings. And we've never really seen that before. I guess, you exclude CrowdStrike last year. I guess I'm trying to understand, do you think this is just the new seasonality that makes Q4 a lot stronger? Or would you say maybe that you under-earned in Q3, and maybe it's some of both? I'm thinking the implications for how to think about next year would be different based on how you think about that dynamic.
Glen Hauenstein: Yeah. Fourth quarter it's actually at or slightly better than the third quarter. And I think it's being driven by strong premium demands and corporate travel in season. So we have a nice long season. If you remember last year, we had the election, and in the October period, we had the country kind of froze right before the election, and unlocked a little bit after the election, but we had that period also have, you know, some favorability in terms of the calendar. So I think the fourth quarter is, as long as business is traveling, is a very strong quarter for us. And I think in the third quarter, particularly in the Transatlantic, we are going to strive to do better in next year's third quarter because we think we have some opportunity should we have to re if we had to replay that to improve our results on the margin.
Scott Group: Okay. So maybe some of both. And then about a point of the revenue growth in Q3 was from MRO, maybe a little help from cargo. Is that sort of sustainable into Q4? And going forward, that MRO strength?
Dan Janki: The MRO over the long term, yes. You're gonna see it. You won't see it every quarter at 60% plus. I'd say both the second and third quarters were quite strong as it related to MRO. For the year, you think of it more in that 20% to 30% range. But we would like to see many years of MRO growth well above the growth of the core airline. And being double-digit. But you won't see it at those levels. You'll see much actually, I think as you fourth quarter, it's probably closer to flat year-over-year. And on cargo, great third quarter. And a shout out to our cargo team. I think they did a fabulous job. We have seen some I'd say, choppiness as we enter the fourth quarter, and we'll see how the final result is. But I wouldn't expect that the 19% would be sustainable into 4Q. It's probably gonna come down from there. And we'll see if it still probably grows in the cargo.
Scott Group: You, guys. Very helpful.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live.
Ravi Shanker: Great. Good morning, everyone. Glen, maybe a couple of follow-ups to your earlier comments, kind of specifically focused on 1Q. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about 1Q network planning just given all the continual noise that continues to be out there? And also what happened last year with the kind of close-in weakness and corporate and everything else? Are you treating last year as a one-off? Or are you kind of being more cautious going into next year because of that?
Glen Hauenstein: I think we're going to head into 1Q the same way we're exiting April, which is with a very strong backdrop. And, you know, the quarter we know the most about is the quarter we're in, and the quarter we know the least about is the fourth quarter of next year. But as the first quarter comes into focus, the demand is looking quite robust. And so let's hope that that spring swoon doesn't occur again next year.
Ravi Shanker: Understood. And just on that topic of 1Q and get focusing on Transatlantic, you guys have been talking about that shoulder season strength for some time now clearly manifesting right now. Last year in December, you said that 1Q of 25 in Transatlantic was setting up for one of the strongest years you've ever seen. And part of that was driven by a favorable US dollar. The dollar is not as favorable right now. But are you from what you can see right now, do you see European strength continuing into 1Q 26 similar to what you saw coming into this?
Glen Hauenstein: Yes.
Ravi Shanker: Easy enough. Thank you.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is live.
Brandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe this one's for Ed or Dan, but you guys think, in your prepared comments talked about your long-term goals of margin improvement. I think everyone would agree on this call that airline stocks could be viewed pretty cheap, but maybe margin growth would really be welcomed for investors. So I guess in that context, what is in your control here as you look into 2026? I'm not necessarily looking for guidance, but does it just have to be a market that's growing capacity a lot less than we have in the past few years? Or it all these things that we're talking about on the commercial side that just gain more momentum? And what can you do on the cost side as well? I think Dan was just hinting at efficiencies there too. Thank you.
Dan Janki: Yeah. No. Cool. You know, I think I'd point you back Thanks for the question. To a lot that we talked about last November. There were a lot of things in there that we talked about that were Delta Air Lines specific as it related to things that are in our control as we look forward and we want to drive. We run the company for margins. We want to drive margins up into the mid-teens. As we laid out. And we feel that the playbook and strategies and priorities in front of us enable us to do that. Starts with those growing up high-margin, revenue streams faster than the core, premiums at the core of that. We talked about premium seats. Growing. Main cabin outpacing the main cabin. So you have more product out there continue to grow the Amex relationship and loyalty faster. So those are things that help you as it relates to the top line, the fleet renewal, supports that. And then you look at the things that we want to do that and still drive good cost performance of low single digit. And, again, it goes back to the growing into the airports, that are already in our run rate. It goes into the fleet actions that we've been growing and simplifying the fleet and getting scale out of it. Associated with it. And then long term continue to grow in get more efficiency, out of not only our workforce, but the entire supply base but also the benefits that technology bring to it. So we want a steady march over time of doing that. Now, certainly, the industry backdrop is we could be beneficial to that. Supply and demand stay in balance. There's real opportunity for that also. To support additional margin growth excess of the things that are Delta Air Lines specific and controlled.
Brandon Oglenski: Well, and just maybe as a really quick follow-up, I think you guys said co-brand spend was up 12%. I might be off on that, but you talk to some of the loyalty drivers right now and how sustainable it is? Looking into next year?
Glen Hauenstein: Well, I think it's been driven by two things. One is the premiumization of the card itself. So we've been acquiring a record number of premium cardholders. And their spend is multiple of what our base member card spend is. So while you look at the total acquisition numbers and say, I think this is our seventh year of a million or more acquisitions, that the mix of those acquisitions is skewing higher and higher in terms of getting reaching a more premium audience. And those customers have better credit scores, so they get approved more often and they spend more on their cards. So that's been really one of the key drivers for us is not only in the total volume, but the number of premium cards we've been able to acquire. And that's driven versus our 2x versus growth versus total card spend. And that's been year after year that we've been able to do that. And looking to continue to do that through '26. And as the more attractive and the more if you think about the question that was preceded about why Austin or why Raleigh? Well, these are high-income growth areas. These are places that we've acquired a lot of cards in. And trying to understand the interaction between the airline and the card and how to maximize both of those together as opposed to just looking at an individual route.
Brandon Oglenski: Thank you, Glen. Thanks, Dan.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is live.
Tom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Wanted to see if you could give maybe a little bit of additional sense of the you know, looking at 26, you know, you're saying that you'll be in line with the multiyear view. So, let's say, 10% earnings growth, something like that. Do you assume that you get to revenue growth, low single-digit revenue growth, some kind of revenue growth in the main cabin? Or should we think about this where you really get there with the good visibility you have on the premium and card and other things? And that's you know, you kinda get to that multiyear growth without a meaningful, swing up in the main cabin.
Glen Hauenstein: Well, I think we've already seen an inflection in the main cabin, which is very exciting to us. And, you know, the trends that we see today are probably the trends that are gonna carry us at least through the beginning part of 2026. So I would expect that the main cabin does have improvement as part of our base as part of our base revenue assumptions for '26. And on top of that, the continued growth of the premium products and the card spend as well. So yeah, I'm excited about the fact that we have finally inflected in the main cabin.
Tom Wadewitz: Okay. But you wouldn't necessarily see that as upside. That's kind of assumed within getting to what, you know, what the multiyear is.
Glen Hauenstein: We haven't given any guidance on that yet. So Yeah. Stay tuned.
Tom Wadewitz: Okay. No. I appreciate that. That's fair enough. The improvement in the main cabin, do you think that that's, like, you know, I think the consumer and especially kinda lower-end consumer is you know, it's unclear whether how optimistic you should be. So do you think that what you've seen in the sales trend that's been favorable is that consumers flying more? Do you think it's just Delta Air Lines' share in kind of industry capacity rationalization that's been beneficial? Or what do you think the kind of bigger driver would be of that improvement you see in 4Q and carrying into '26?
Glen Hauenstein: At the low end of the industry, there's been a lot of seats removed. And that's allowed us to get a footing on fares. I think when you think about the financial performance of the carriers that are catering to the lower-income customers have not been good. Know, someone had to declare bankruptcy. And know, it's the restructurings that they're going through and having to get higher fares. They can't they need they need more money to survive. And so, you know, we had one of our competitors say something, but it's just math. Well, it is just math. That's it. They have to get their fares higher. In terms of and that helps us get a footing on our main cabin as well.
Julie Stewart: Matthew, we'll now go to our final analyst question.
Matthew: Certainly. Your last question is coming from David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is live.
David Vernon: Good morning team and thanks for fitting me in here. So Glen, maybe just a quick micro question for you in terms of the competitive capacity being down in Delta Air Lines hubs year-over-year. I'm wondering if you're seeing any kind of difference in domestic revenue trends in your hubs versus some of the point-to-point leisure markets? I'm trying to get a lot of questions about whether kinda what you're seeing in the main cabin is gonna be an industry-wide thing or more of a Delta Air Lines specific thing.
Glen Hauenstein: Well, we have three categories. We have coastal gateways, we have core hubs, and then we have focus cities. And they've all been behaving well. I'd say the biggest improvements have been in the coastal cities where we've seen a big uptick, and these are also the biggest and wealthiest cities in the country, the New York, the LAs, the Boston, Seattle. Where corporate travel is significantly improving year-over-year and our share is improving. So that's really been a big driver of it. And the hubs have been performing very, very well. And our focus cities, the ones that we're investing in are as expected. So yeah, I think it's a broad brush improvement from where we were just, you know, ninety days ago.
David Vernon: Excellent. Thanks for that. And then maybe just if we kinda step back for a second, coming back to the commentary around earnings consistent with a long-term financial framework. You know, given the weakness and the know, the weirdness of, frankly, of 2025 with the second-quarter slowdown, some of the irregular ops days. I mean, if we don't have something like that repeat is there any reason to think that we shouldn't be at the upper end of the framework you guys have laid out in past. I'm just thinking just the comps are just gonna be so much easier in for a big part of next year that maybe we shouldn't be thinking that I'm wondering if there's a reason we shouldn't be thinking it would be at the higher end of your longer-term financial framework.
Ed Bastian: Hi, David. This is Ed. I'll take that. We haven't given 26 specific insights yet nor have we completed our planning process, so we'll probably be better equipped to talk about that towards the end of this year or early next year. But no question, we saw some pretty strong headwinds that came quite abruptly hit us in late January, early February. You know, we had the aircraft incidents which certainly hurt revenue growth in some important markets. Had a lot of the trade uncertainties while consumer confidence plummeting. And to the point where Delta Air Lines, as you recall, we wound up pulling our guide. There was so much uncertainty for a short period of time. So no question if we have some tailwinds as we look forward into the New Year. And if today's environment projects into '26, I think '20 can be a really strong year.
David Vernon: That's very helpful. Thank you very much for the time.
Julie Stewart: Alright, Matthew. That will wrap up the analyst portion of the call. I'll now turn it over to Tim Mapes to start the media questions.
Tim Mapes: Thank you, Julie. Matthew, as we transition from the analysts to members of the media, if you wouldn't mind please, describing how best to enter into the call queue and the process for one follow-up, please.
Matthew: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a Q&A session for media questions. Please hold while we poll for questions. Thank you. And once again, everyone, if you have any questions or comments, please press star then 1 on your phone. Please hold while we poll for questions. Your first question is coming from Leslie Josephs. Your line is live.
Leslie Josephs: Hi, everyone. We've seen Amex, Chase, and some others raise credit card fees. Just wondering if you see any pushback from customers in terms of acquisitions on your end, if you think that credit card annual fees at least can keep going up. And then my second question, also seeing really long upgrade lists, which I guess would be good for you guys because you have a lot of elites. Not just on your airline, but others. And curious how you're managing that and if the percentage of paid seats in premium has gone up since the last time you've updated everybody. Thanks.
Glen Hauenstein: Card fees, but we also injected a lot of value for customers, and we had a record acquisition this year. And so very pleased with the results. I can't really comment on the results of Amex or Chase. But I would say as long as you're providing more value to the customers, it seems like a pretty safe bet that there's gonna be strong demand for those premium products across the spectrum. And in terms of our standby list, yes, there's a long standby list, and we have a lot of premium customers. And that's one of the reasons we've expanded our Comfort Plus offerings because our most elite customers are allowed to upgrade into those products at the time of booking. And we didn't have enough of those. If you look across the spectrum, we were generally sold out of Comfort Plus early in the booking curve and now being able to increase that so we can accommodate more of our most premium customers with premium offerings at the time of booking.
Leslie Josephs: Okay.
Matthew: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News. Your line is live.
Mary Schlangenstein: Hi. Good morning. In your forecast for Transatlantic travel, I'm wondering if you still expect that to be mostly driven by US point of sale do you see a rebound from non-US based customers?
Glen Hauenstein: You know, it's always been US point of sale, rather. And so the question is how US point of sale will it be? Know, and our point of sale revenue on a revenue we're approaching 80% US point of origin. So yes. We hope that there's going to be more. The dollar, of course, has strengthened. That makes coming to America more of a bargain for customers. And so, hopefully, we see that translate into a little bit higher European point of sale. But we are mostly a US point of origin-driven company.
Mary Schlangenstein: And what are some of the other factors that are ongoing that you see constricting non-US point of sale? Is it still some of the, like, concerns over immigration policies, things like that?
Glen Hauenstein: There's clearly safety concerns. There's a whole host of concerns of travel to the US, but I think, you know, we still have a great product here, and we have great cities, and we have people with relatives and friends and family. And so there's gonna be demand. The question is how much demand? And the good news for us is we're not totally dependent on that. It's not our core business. But I would expect, hopefully, that next year is a little bit better than this year for European point of sale. For nothing else is that the appreciation of the euro has made European fares look relatively more attractive.
Ed Bastian: And, Mary, this is Ed. You know, the conversation, it's also on the margins. Right? It isn't as if Europeans stopped traveling. They're still traveling at large numbers. The numbers may be down. 5%, 7% in some of the markets. You know, we're long-term, think our business model is very healthy for global expansion, and you're gonna continue to see us pursue that.
Mary Schlangenstein: Great. Thank you very much.
Tim Mapes: Thanks, Mary, and congratulations. Matthew, let's squeeze one more in, please.
Matthew: Certainly. Your last question is coming from Niraj Chokshi from New York Times. Your line is live.
Niraj Chokshi: Hey. Thank you. I was just curious. You know, there's some talk about the industry sort of bifurcating, you know, Delta Air Lines and United on one side doing very well and then sort of the rest. And, you know, I guess, do you agree with that assessment? And then if so, is it structural? Is it an industry phase? Just sort of curious to get your sort of sense of what's happening.
Ed Bastian: It's clearly happening. If you look at the results this quarter, as I mentioned on CNBC this morning, we expect 60% of the overall industry profits to be driven by Delta Air Lines. Expect the rest of it probably to be driven by United. Largely. And then you have everybody else, and this is not a new phenomenon. This has been happening really since COVID hit over the last four or five years. Know, there's a lot about the industry fundamentals that have changed. That we at Delta Air Lines are driving a much higher level of quality experience, whether it's reliability, whether it's the product and services that we offer, whether it's the partners we're bringing to the table, whether it's the expansion internationally. And if you are in a category that is, you know, seen as more of a commodity, purchase. That they're having a very difficult time. You know, their cost structures have increased. As labor costs have gone up. Been very difficult to get airplanes to get supply growth, those lower-end models depend on high growth. And there's a lot of congestion in the US marketplace in terms of the sky. So I think the bifurcation you're seeing is gonna continue. And eventually, there'll need to be rationalization to enable the lower end of the price spectrum to continue to sustain itself, to be able to continue to attract capital. And I think we're seeing this all play out right in front of our eyes.
Niraj Chokshi: Thank you.
Tim Mapes: Matthew, that will wrap this up, please.
Matthew: Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation today.

    - Similarity/difference: $830M (current) vs $687M (2024-Q3). Explicitly: current FCF is higher (improved quarter-over-quarter compared with that past quarter).
  - 2024-Q3 — Free Cash Flow (YTD reference): "Nearly $3 billion year-to-date"
    - Similarity/difference: Current YTD FCF (see below) is slightly below that prior "nearly $3B" figure.

- Year-to-date free cash flow: "$2.8 billion" (current)
  - 2024-Q3 — "Nearly $3 billion year-to-date"
    - Similarity/difference: $2.8B (current) vs "nearly $3B" (prior). Explicitly: current YTD is slightly lower but in the same ballpark.

- Return on invested capital: "13%, five points above our cost of capital" (current)
  - 2024-Q3 — "More than twice the industry average" (qualitative)
    - Similarity/difference: Both emphasize strong ROIC. Current explicit 13% quantifies the strength; prior statement was qualitative. Explicitly: current provides a concrete 13% figure consistent with prior messaging of superior returns.

- Cargo revenue: "Cargo revenues increased 19% driven by the Pacific." (current)
  - 2024-Q3 — Cargo Revenue: "27% higher than last year"
    - Similarity/difference: +19% (current) vs +27% (2024-Q3). Explicitly: cargo growth slowed compared to that earlier quarter.

- American Express remuneration in quarter: "increased 12% over the prior year to $2 billion in the quarter" (current)
  - 2024-Q3 — American Express Remuneration: "$1.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year"
    - Similarity/difference: $2.0B and +12% (current) vs $1.8B and +6% (2024-Q3). Explicitly: current Amex remuneration is higher in both level and growth.

- Non-fuel unit cost growth (YTD and quarter): "year-to-date non-fuel unit cost growth to less than 2%" and "Non-fuel unit cost growth was approximately flat to the prior year" (current)
  - 2024-Q3 — Non-Fuel Unit Costs: "Up 5.7%, including a 3.2 point impact from the outage"
    - Similarity/difference: YTD <2% / quarter ~flat (current) vs +5.7% (2024-Q3). Explicitly: current non-fuel cost growth is materially lower (improved) versus the prior reported increase.

- September quarter operating cash flow and capex: "operating cash flow of $1.8 billion, and after reinvesting $1.1 billion ... free cash flow of $830 million." (current)
  - 2024-Q3 — Operating Cash Flow: 1,847,000,000
    - Similarity/difference: $1.8B (current) vs $1.847B (2024-Q3). Explicitly: operating cash flow is similar (within a small rounding difference).

- Debt paydown year-to-date and leverage: "debt paydown of nearly $2 billion year-to-date, with gross leverage ending the quarter at 2.4 times." (current)
  - 2024-Q3 — Debt Repayment: "Nearly $4 billion of debt expected to be repaid this year"
    - Similarity/difference: Nearly $2B YTD (current) vs nearly $4B expected for the year (prior). Explicitly: the company has reduced debt meaningfully year-to-date, but the YTD paydown ($~2B) is smaller than the prior-year stated target/expectation figure.

- Net income / bottom-line context:
  - 2024-Q3 — Net Income: 1,417,000,000
    - Similarity/difference: Current reported pretax income $1.5B is slightly above 2024-Q3 net income ($1.417B) in absolute dollars, but measures differ (pretax vs net). Explicitly: pretax $1.5B compares roughly in magnitude to last period net income $1.417B, but EPS and operating margin are lower versus the comparable period.

Overall bottom-line trends (concise)
- Improvements: quarter FCF ($830M) is higher than the 2024-Q3 quarter FCF ($687M). YTD non-fuel cost control is substantially improved (<2% vs prior +5.7%), which supports margins going forward. Amex remuneration and certain diversified revenue streams (e.g., loyalty, premium, travel-adjacent) show stronger growth vs prior-year references.
- Weaknesses/declines: operating margin (11.2%) and EPS ($1.71) are lower than some prior comparable quarters (e.g., operating margin 13.5%, EPS 2.19). Pretax income ($1.5B) is below the most recent quarter (2025-Q2 $1.8B) and slightly below a 2024-Q4 $1.6B reference. Total revenue in this dataset ($15.2B) is lower than the 2024-Q3 revenue snapshot ($16.673B).
- Net income implication: while pretax and cash generation remain solid, EPS and operating margin declines indicate that bottom-line per-share profitability is lower than the most recent comparable quarter(s), even as cash flow and cost control improved.

2. Supported outcomes (management comments confirmed by numbers)
- Management claimed improved cost control: Dan’s statements on non-fuel unit cost growth improving (YTD <2%, quarter approx flat) are confirmed versus the prior reported +5.7% — a clear improvement in cost trajectory.
- Management highlighted strong cash generation and deleveraging: reported quarter operating cash flow ~$1.8B and quarter FCF $830M, and YTD free cash flow $2.8B, confirm the claim of robust cash generation (though YTD FCF is slightly below the earlier "nearly $3B" reference). Debt paydown "nearly $2B YTD" confirms meaningful deleveraging, supporting management's balance-sheet commentary (even if earlier references cited larger annual repayment ambitions).
- Management emphasized diversified high-margin revenue streams and Amex strength: the $2.0B Amex remuneration (up 12%) and double-digit growth in several high-margin categories confirm management’s claims about revenue diversification and strength in co-brand spend.
- Management noted unit revenue and corporate demand recovery: Glen’s comments that domestic unit revenue turned positive and corporate sales grew (domestic corporate double-digits / corporate sales up 8%) is consistent with prior commentary about unit revenue improving sequentially; the numeric signs of recovery support the operational narrative.

- 現金產生與去槓桿：管理層強調強勁現金產生與降低負債的說法，由季度營運現金流 約 $1.8B、季度 FCF $830M 與 YTD FCF $2.8B 支持（YTD FCF 與先前「接近 $3B」相近但略低）。YTD 近 $2B 的債務償還也確認了去槓桿行動，支持資產負債表改善論述（但量級小於先前提及的全年近 $4B 範圍）。
- 收入多元化與 Amex 強勁：$2.0B 的 Amex 報酬（+12%）以及多項高毛利項目的雙位數增長，確認管理層對於收入多元化與聯名卡消費回復的說法。
- 單位營收與企業需求回升：Glen 關於國內單位營收轉正與企業銷售成長（企業銷售 +8%、國內企業雙位數等）的說法，與先前關於單位營收在各區域逐季改善的表述一致，數字上顯示營運恢復的跡象。

Historical‑Calls note:
English

1) Validate past guidance (met / beat / missed)
- Return on invested capital (historical target: "5 points ahead of our cost of capital" — 2024‑Q3): Met. Current 2025‑Q3 ROIC = 13%, described as "five points above our cost of capital."
- Return on invested capital (historical target: "Double‑digit" — 2025‑Q1): Met. Current 2025‑Q3 ROIC = 13% (double‑digit).
- Non‑fuel unit cost guidance (historical: "low single‑digit" expected — 2025‑Q1 / 2024‑Q4): Beat. Current 2025‑Q3 non‑fuel unit cost: approximately flat for the quarter and year‑to‑date non‑fuel unit cost growth < 2% (better / lower than a generic low‑single‑digit increase).
- Operating margin guidance (historical: "11% to 14%" for a recent quarter — 2025‑Q1): Met. Current 2025‑Q3 operating margin = 11.2%, inside that 11%–14% range.
- Full‑year EPS posture (historical: "around the midpoint of our initial $6 to $7 EPS guidance" — 2024‑Q3): Partially missed the implied midpoint. Current 2025‑Q3 update for full‑year 2025 EPS ≈ $6.00, which is below the prior "around midpoint" (~$6.50) but still inside the original $6–$7 range.

(If a prior forward‑looking item did not clearly refer to a metric that can be measured by a 2025‑Q3 reported number, it was omitted per your instruction.)

2) Compare results discussed (concrete numbers)
- Revenue: Grew ~4% year‑over‑year to $15.2 billion in 2025‑Q3 (Glen said +4.1% to $15.2B; Ed said "Revenue grew 4%").
- Profitability: 2025‑Q3 operating margin = 11.2%; pretax income = $1.5 billion; EPS = $1.71.
- Cash generation: Free cash flow for the quarter = $830 million; year‑to‑date free cash flow = $2.8 billion; updated full‑year FCF outlook = $3.5B–$4.0B.
- Capital efficiency: ROIC = 13%, stated as five points above cost of capital.
- Revenue mix / growth drivers: High‑margin / diversified streams = 60% of revenue; premium revenue +9%; loyalty revenue +9%; travel‑adjacent products mid‑teens growth; cargo +19% (Pacific driven); MRO revenue >60% growth.
- Commercial signals: Corporate (business) travel up high single digits in the quarter; domestic corporate sales grew double digits (mid‑teens in coastal hubs); domestic unit revenue turned positive and total unit revenue +0.3% YoY.
- Costs & operations: Non‑fuel unit costs roughly flat for the September quarter and YTD <2% growth; on‑time performance, completion factor and NPS outperforming industry YTD.
- Amex / loyalty: Amex co‑brand remuneration in the quarter increased 12% YoY to $2.0 billion; SkyMiles Amex co‑brand spend up double digits YTD.

3) Supporting evidence (historical statement → current result)

Peers note:
Analysis — how Delta's reasoning differs from comparable firms (with cited historical-call evidence)

- September quarter revenue growth (\"Revenue grew 4%\"): Delta presents the 4% growth as part of a record quarter and ties it to diversified, high-margin businesses; comparable firms report similar headline growth but typically as a standalone metric (e.g., FIS reported \"4%\" revenue growth in 2024-Q4; IBM reported \"4%\" revenue growth in 2024-Q2). (Evidence: FIS 2024-Q4 \"4%\"; IBM 2024-Q2 \"4%\")

- September quarter revenue level (\"$15.2 billion\"): Delta emphasizes scale and a third‑quarter record ($15.2 billion). Comparable historical calls report materially smaller absolute revenue figures and focus on percent change rather than framing a company‑scale record (e.g., AKAM $980 million Q2 2024; ADBE $5.41 billion Q3 2024). (Evidence: AKAM 2024-Q2 \"$980 million\"; ADBE 2024-Q3 \"$5.41 billion\")

- September quarter operating margin (\"11.2% operating margin\"): Delta frames 11.2% as a strong, achieved operating performance. Comparable firms vary; some report lower margins (UPS 9.5% in 2024-Q2) or similar segment margins (LMT 11.3% in 2024-Q2), showing Delta’s margin sits toward the stronger end of peers cited. (Evidence: UPS 2024-Q2 \"9.5%\"; LMT 2024-Q2 \"11.3%\")

- September quarter pretax income (\"$1.5 billion\"): Delta reports $1.5 billion as realized pretax income; comparable calls report similar magnitudes occasionally (DHI reported \"$1.5 billion\" in 2024-Q2) but often emphasize trends (growth rates) rather than Delta’s framing around margin/return context. (Evidence: DHI 2024-Q2 \"$1.5 billion\")

- September quarter EPS (\"$1.71 per share\"): Delta cites $1.71 EPS as achieved earnings. Comparable firms reported close but not identical EPS figures (DG $1.78 in 2025-Q1; AAPL $1.64 in 2024-Q4), and their commentary often highlights beats/expectations rather than Delta’s emphasis on underlying revenue mix and returns. (Evidence: DG 2025-Q1 \"$1.78\"; AAPL 2024-Q4 \"$1.64\")

- September quarter free cash flow (\"$830 million\"): Delta highlights $830 million FCF generation. Comparable firms report quarter FCFs in the same ballpark but sometimes lower (EBAY $803 million Q3 2025; FIS $700 million Q4 2024), showing Delta’s cash generation is strong relative to some peers. (Evidence: EBAY 2025-Q3 \"$803 million\"; FIS 2024-Q4 \"$700 million\")

- Return on invested capital (\"13%, five points above our cost of capital\"): Delta frames ROIC relative to cost of capital (value creation). Comparable calls report ROIC percentages (GLW 13.1% 2025-Q2) but rarely include the explicit “points above cost of capital” framing—Delta stresses capital returns vs peers. (Evidence: GLW 2025-Q2 \"13.1%\")

- Domestic unit revenue change (\"Domestic unit revenue turned positive… total unit revenue improved by 0.3% over last year.\"): Delta emphasizes a turn to positive domestic unit revenue and modest total unit rev improvement. Comparable companies often report region- or segment-level revenue increases without the same unit-revenue turn emphasis (e.g., MGM noted domestic revenue up in Jan; UPS reported U.S. domestic revenue $14.5B 2025-Q1). (Evidence: MGM 2024-Q4; UPS 2025-Q1 \"$14.5 billion\")

- High-margin / diversified revenue contribution (\"contributed 60% of total revenue\"): Delta highlights that 60% of revenue comes from diverse, high-margin streams to explain resilience. Comparable calls quantify product concentration (e.g., SWKS mobile revenue 62% of total Q2 2025) but many peers focus on overall revenue growth rather than framing a resilience story driven by high‑margin mix. (Evidence: SWKS 2025-Q2 \"Mobile Revenue: 62% of total\")

- Premium revenue growth (\"Premium revenue grew 9%\"): Delta points to premium product strength driving growth. Comparable firms show loyalty/membership or product growth but generally at different magnitudes (EXPE loyalty membership growth ~7% in 2024-Q4), so Delta’s 9% premium growth is presented as a relatively stronger premium-product performance. (Evidence: EXPE 2024-Q4 \"7% growth\")

- Loyalty revenue growth (\"Loyalty revenue improved 9%\"): Delta ties loyalty revenue growth to broader revenue resilience. Comparable travel peer data (EXPE) show loyalty metrics improving (7%); Delta’s 9% is framed as an above‑peer loyalty-dollar improvement. (Evidence: EXPE 2024-Q4 \"7%\")

- Travel-adjacent product revenue growth (\"travel-adjacent products grew mid-teens\"): Delta highlights mid‑teens growth in travel-adjacent offerings as diversification. Comparable peers (EXPE) cite double-digit room-night growth, but many peers report smaller or unspecified contributions; Delta emphasizes breadth and higher-rate growth in adjacent lines. (Evidence: EXPE 2024-Q4 \"Room Nights Growing Double Digits\")

- Cargo revenue growth (\"Cargo revenues increased 19% driven by the Pacific\"): Delta attributes a large, geography-driven cargo gain. Comparable calls in the set do not emphasize cargo to this degree; Delta’s explicit geography driver (Pacific) and double-digit cargo growth are distinguishing. (No direct comparable cargo entries in provided historical calls)

- MRO revenue growth (\"Maintenance, repair, and overhaul revenue grew more than 60%\"): Delta points to >60% MRO growth as a material non‑ticket revenue stream. Comparable historical calls in the sample do not report similar MRO jumps; this makes Delta’s MRO growth a distinctive driver of its diversified revenue messaging. (No direct comparable MRO entries in provided historical calls)

- Amex remuneration in quarter (\"increased 12% over the prior year to $2 billion in the quarter\"): Delta cites a large co‑brand remuneration figure and growth rate as a significant revenue contributor; comparable firms in the sample seldom report a single partnership payment of this size—Delta emphasizes the scale and growth of its co‑brand relationship. (No direct comparable Amex entries in provided historical calls)

- Non-fuel unit cost growth year-to-date (\"year-to-date non-fuel unit cost growth to less than 2%\"): Delta stresses cost discipline and minimal non‑fuel unit cost inflation. Comparable commentary often discusses cost trends more generally; few in the sample quantify YTD non‑fuel unit cost under 2%, making Delta’s tight cost-control message notable. (No direct comparable non‑fuel unit cost entries in provided historical calls)

- Non-fuel unit cost growth for September quarter (\"approximately flat to the prior year\"): Delta reports flat quarterly non‑fuel unit costs, reinforcing operational efficiency. Comparable calls focus on cost reductions or margin improvements but typically report percent changes rather than flatness (examples vary). (No direct comparable entry specifying flat non‑fuel unit cost in provided calls)

- US economic backdrop (\"The US economy remains on solid footing, and our customer base is financially strong.\"): Delta frames demand as resilient and financially healthy. Comparable companies similarly described macro resilience (RCL: \"resilient economy, low unemployment\" 2024-Q2; EBAY: \"Healthy consumer demand\" 2025-Q2), so Delta aligns with peers but ties that directly to customer travel propensity. (Evidence: RCL 2024-Q2 \"resilient economy\"; EBAY 2025-Q2 \"Healthy consumer demand\")

- On-time performance, completion factor, NPS vs industry (\"Year-to-date, we are outperforming the industry…\"): Delta uses operational KPIs (OTP, completion factor, NPS) as competitive advantages. Comparable calls cite NPS improvements (PAYC increased NPS by 16 points 2025-Q1) or outperforming benchmarks, but Delta frames operational outperformance as a structural differentiator for profitability. (Evidence: PAYC 2025-Q1 \"Increased another 16 points year-over-year\")

- Fleet deliveries in 2025 and 2026 (\"approximately 40 aircraft deliveries this year and next\"): Delta provides a two‑year fleet delivery expectation to support capacity planning. Comparable firms discuss deliveries but at different scales or in different industries (HII: \"Five deliveries\" next two years; LMT: \"170 to 190 deliveries\" for F‑35 programs), so Delta’s ~40 aircraft is modest compared with defense OEMs but relevant to airline capacity strategy. (Evidence: HII 2024-Q4 \"Five deliveries\"; LMT 2025-Q2 \"170 to 190 deliveries\")

- Structural changes in industry capacity and profitability (\"Structural change has taken hold across the industry… carriers not earning their cost of capital adjust strategies\"): Delta emphasizes industry rationalization and a shift toward return-focused capacity decisions. Comparable calls similarly flag profitability pressure and shifting dynamics (VRSK: \"Carriers focus on profitability\" 2024-Q3; ZBH: \"Improving pricing dynamics\" 2024-Q1), but Delta’s language is more explicit about industry profit bifurcation. (Evidence: VRSK 2024-Q3 \"Carriers focus on profitability\"; ZBH 2024-Q1 \"Improving pricing dynamics\")

- Industry supply-demand outlook into 2026 (\"we expect a very healthy supply-demand balance across the industry into 2026.\"): Delta is optimistic on balance into 2026. Comparable firms have mixed takes—some expect persistent imbalances (LW: \"imbalance will persist through much, if not all, of fiscal 2025\" 2024-Q4), so Delta’s view is relatively more positive/optimistic. (Evidence: LW 2024-Q4 \"imbalance will persist through much, if not all, of fiscal 2025\")

- FX impact on inbound US demand (\"the dollar… has strengthened. That makes coming to America more of a bargain… appreciation of the euro… makes European fares look relatively more attractive.\"): Delta links currency moves directly to regional demand flows and pricing. Comparable travel peers made similar observations about the dollar benefiting U.S. travelers (EXPE 2024-Q4 noted stronger dollar benefits U.S. travelers), so Delta aligns with peer macro commentary. (Evidence: EXPE 2024-Q4 \"Stronger dollar benefits US travelers\")

- Industry bifurcation / business models (\"we expect 60% of the overall industry profits to be driven by Delta… rest… probably… by United… If you are… a commodity… they’re having a very difficult time\"): Delta explicitly claims it (with United) will capture a disproportionate share of industry profits, highlighting structural advantages. Comparable firms discuss strained profitability or capacity dynamics (DOW 2025-Q2 \"Strained profitability across our industry\"), but Delta’s explicit profit-share projection is a stronger, more aggressive competitive positioning than typical peer commentary. (Evidence: DOW 2025-Q2 \"Strained profitability across our industry\")

- Lower-fare carrier financial stress (\"financial performance of the carriers… catering to the lower-income customers have not been good… someone had to declare bankruptcy\"): Delta points to competitor distress as a structural tailwind for pricing. Comparable transportation-sector callers noted weak industry financial health (JBHT: \"the financial health of the transportation industry is not great\" 2025-Q3), so Delta’s framing matches peer concern but applies it as a pricing/industry consolidation argument. (Evidence: JBHT 2025-Q3 \"financial health of the transportation industry is not great\")

- Relative performance of domestic vs international margins in 2025 (\"this year, they’re relatively similar. They’ve converged on each other\"): Delta reports margin convergence domestically and internationally. Comparable peers describe improving international contribution margins (DASH: \"Improving\" 2024-Q4), but Delta emphasizes parity as a notable outcome of its strategy. (Evidence: DASH 2024-Q4 \"Improving\")

- Transatlantic capacity growth approach for next summer (\"probably low single digits… very, very low single digits if growth at all in very peak months of July and August… slightly higher shoulder season\"): Delta signals tight, conservative capacity growth for Transatlantic peak season. Comparable travel/holiday peers forecast modest growth or modest pricing improvements (NCLH: pricing growth 3.6% for Q1 2025), but Delta’s emphasis on ultra-low peak growth is more explicit on capacity restraint. (Evidence: NCLH 2024-Q4 \"3.6%\" pricing growth)

分析 — 公司自身表述與可比公司不同之處（並引用歷史電話會議證據）

- 九月季營收成長（「Revenue grew 4%」）：Delta 將 4% 成長作為創紀錄季度的一部分，並將其歸因於多元且高利潤的業務；可比公司通常僅報出同樣的標題成長率而不一定同時強調收入結構（例如 FIS 2024-Q4 報告「4%」；IBM 2024-Q2 報告「4%」）。(證據: FIS 2024-Q4 「4%」；IBM 2024-Q2 「4%」)

- 九月季營收金額（「$15.2 billion」）：Delta 強調規模與第三季紀錄（$15.2B）。可比公司通常報出較小的絕對營收並更強調變動率，而非公司規模記錄（例如 AKAM $980M 2024-Q2；ADBE $5.41B 2024-Q3）。(證據: AKAM 2024-Q2 「$980 million」；ADBE 2024-Q3 「$5.41 billion」)

- 九月季營業利潤率（「11.2% operating margin」）：Delta 將 11.2% 描述為強勁已實現表現。可比公司有較低或相近的利潤率報告（UPS 2024-Q2 為 9.5%；LMT 2024-Q2 為 11.3%），顯示 Delta 的利潤率在所列同儕中偏向較高水準。(證據: UPS 2024-Q2 「9.5%」；LMT 2024-Q2 「11.3%」)

- 九月季稅前盈餘（「$1.5 billion」）：Delta 報告 $1.5B 的實際稅前盈餘；可比公司偶有相近金額（DHI 2024-Q2 報告「$1.5 billion」），但可比公司常聚焦成長率而非 Delta 所強調的利潤與報酬背景。(證據: DHI 2024-Q2 「$1.5 billion」)

- 九月季每股盈餘（「$1.71 per share」）：Delta 報 $1.71 EPS 為已實現數字。可比公司報出相近但不完全相同的 EPS（DG 2025-Q1 $1.78；AAPL 2024-Q4 $1.64），且可比公司評論多強調超出預期/增長，而非 Delta 著重的收入組合與回報驅動。(證據: DG 2025-Q1 \"$1.78\"；AAPL 2024-Q4 \"$1.64\")

- 九月季自由現金流（「$830 million」）：Delta 強調本季產生 $830M FCF。可比公司亦有季度 FCF 報告但常較低（EBAY 2025-Q3 $803M；FIS 2024-Q4 $700M），顯示 Delta 的現金產生在部分同儕中屬強勢。(證據: EBAY 2025-Q3 \"$803 million\"；FIS 2024-Q4 \"$700 million\")

- 投資資本回報率（「13%, five points above our cost of capital」）：Delta 將 ROIC 與資本成本差距（高出 5 個百分點）連結以強調創造價值。可比公司報出 ROIC 數值（GLW 2025-Q2 13.1%），但少有像 Delta 明確以「高於資本成本」來表述——Delta 更強調資本回報相對性。(證據: GLW 2025-Q2 \"13.1%\")

- 國內單位收入變化（「Domestic unit revenue turned positive… total unit revenue improved by 0.3%」）：Delta 強調國內單位收入由負轉正並且總單位收入微升 0.3%。可比公司會報區域或部門營收升幅但較少強調「單位收入轉正」的關鍵轉折（例如 MGM 報國內營收自 Jan 開始上升；UPS 2025-Q1 報美國國內營收 $14.5B）。(證據: MGM 2024-Q4；UPS 2025-Q1 \"$14.5 billion\")

- 高利潤/多元化收入貢獻（「contributed 60% of total revenue」）：Delta 強調 60% 營收來自多元且高利潤來源以解釋抗壓性。可比公司也會量化產品集中度（如 SWKS 2025-Q2 移動營收佔 62%），但多數同儕更多聚焦整體成長而非以「高比重高利潤組合」做韌性論述。(證據: SWKS 2025-Q2 \"Mobile Revenue: 62% of total\")

- 高階票種營收成長（「Premium revenue grew 9%」）：Delta 指出高階產品是成長動能。可比公司亦有忠誠/會員成長數據（EXPE 忠誠會員成長 ~7% 2024-Q4），因此 Delta 的 9% 在同類指標中呈現較強表現。(證據: EXPE 2024-Q4 \"7% growth\")

- 忠誠營收成長（「Loyalty revenue improved 9%」）：Delta 將忠誠營收成長視為整體營收韌性來源。可比旅行業者的忠誠指標為 7%（EXPE），Delta 的 9% 被呈現為超越同業的忠誠營收改善。(證據: EXPE 2024-Q4 \"7%\")

- 旅遊相關產品營收成長（「travel-adjacent products grew mid-teens」）：Delta 強調旅遊外延產品中高成長（中雙位數）。可比公司（EXPE）也報雙位數房夜或相關成長，但多數同儕未明確報出「中雙位數」且著重核心旅遊指標；Delta 用以突顯產品多元化成效。(證據: EXPE 2024-Q4 \"Room Nights Growing Double Digits\")

- 貨運營收成長（「Cargo revenues increased 19% driven by the Pacific」）：Delta 指出貨運年增 19%，並明確由太平洋線帶動。樣本中可比公司少有這類貨運細節；因此 Delta 的地理驅動與高雙位數貨運增長較為突出。(證據: 提供樣本中無直接貨運比較條目)

- MRO 營收成長（「Maintenance, repair, and overhaul revenue grew more than 60%」）：Delta 將 >60% 的 MRO 成長列為重要非票務收入來源。樣本中無類似大幅 MRO 成長案例，使得 Delta 在收入多元化論述上更獨特。(證據: 提供樣本中無直接 MRO 比較條目)

- 與 Amex 的分潤（「increased 12% over the prior year to $2 billion in the quarter」）：Delta 報告與合作卡的大額分潤成長並強調其規模與貢獻。樣本公司很少報出此類規模單一夥伴支付，因此 Delta 在強調合作收入規模方面較為獨特。(證據: 提供樣本中無直接 Amex 比較條目)

- 年初至今非燃油單位成本增長（「year-to-date non-fuel unit cost growth to less than 2%」）：Delta 強調成本紀律並將非燃油單位成本控制在 <2%。樣本中的公司雖談成本趨勢，但少有具體宣稱 YTD 非燃油單位成本低於 2%，因此 Delta 的精確控制數字具差異化。(證據: 提供樣本中無直接非燃油單位成本條目)

- 九月季非燃油單位成本（「Non-fuel unit cost growth was approximately flat to the prior year」）：Delta 報告季度成本接近平盤以強化營運效率論點。樣本公司多以百分比或節省金額表述成本走勢，很少以「近乎持平」作為主要訊息。(證據: 提供樣本中無直接平盤非燃油單位成本條目)

- 美國經濟背景（「The US economy remains on solid footing, and our customer base is financially strong.」）：Delta 將需求歸因於美國經濟韌性與客戶財務健康。可比公司也做出類似宏觀正面判斷（RCL 2024-Q2 描述為「resilient economy」；EBAY 2025-Q2 說「Healthy consumer demand」），因此 Delta 與同業在宏觀判斷上趨同，但 Delta 明確將其連結至旅客消費意願。(證據: RCL 2024-Q2 \"resilient economy\"；EBAY 2025-Q2 \"Healthy consumer demand\")

- 準時性、完成率、淨推薦分數相對業界（「Year-to-date, we are outperforming the industry…」）：Delta 將 OTP、完成率與 NPS 作為競爭優勢。可比公司亦報 NPS 上升（PAYC 2025-Q1 NPS 增加 16 點），但 Delta 把此類營運 KPI 明確用作獲利差異化的論點。(證據: PAYC 2025-Q1 \"Increased another 16 points year-over-year\")

- 2025 與 2026 機隊交付（「approximately 40 aircraft deliveries this year and next.」）：Delta 提供兩年交機預期以支持產能規劃。可比公司談交付但規模或性質不同（HII 未來兩年「Five deliveries」；LMT F‑35 計劃「170 to 190 deliveries」），因此 Delta 的 ~40 架在航空公司語境下是關鍵的產能指標，但與防務 OEM 比較尺度不同。(證據: HII 2024-Q4 \"Five deliveries\"；LMT 2025-Q2 \"170 to 190 deliveries\")

- 產業供給與獲利結構變化（「Structural change has taken hold… carriers not earning their cost of capital adjust strategies」）：Delta 強調不賺資本成本的航班被理性化並朝回報導向調整。可比公司亦談盈利壓力與策略調整（VRSK 2024-Q3 說「Carriers focus on profitability」；ZBH 2024-Q1 提到「Improving pricing dynamics」），但 Delta 在描述利潤分化與結構性改變時更為直接。(證據: VRSK 2024-Q3 \"Carriers focus on profitability\"；ZBH 2024-Q1 \"Improving pricing dynamics\")

- 展望 2026 的產業供需（「we expect a very healthy supply-demand balance across the industry into 2026.」）：Delta 對未來供需平衡持較樂觀態度。可比公司觀點不一——有些公司預期失衡會持續（LW 2024-Q4 認為 2025 大部分時間失衡會持續），故 Delta 的看法相對偏正面。(證據: LW 2024-Q4 \"imbalance will persist through much, if not all, of fiscal 2025\")

- 匯率對赴美需求的影響（「the dollar… has strengthened… makes coming to America more of a bargain… appreciation of the euro… makes European fares… more attractive.」）：Delta 將匯率變動直接連結至區域需求與價格。可比旅行同業亦做類似觀察（EXPE 2024-Q4 指出強勢美元利於美國旅客），因此 Delta 在此點與同業一致。(證據: EXPE 2024-Q4 \"Stronger dollar benefits US travelers\")

- 產業分化／商業模式（「we expect 60% of the overall industry profits to be driven by Delta… rest… probably… by United… If you are… a commodity… they’re having a very difficult time」）：Delta 明確表示將與 United 攫取多數產業利潤，凸顯其結構性優勢。可比公司討論利潤緊張或產能動態（DOW 2025-Q2 說「Strained profitability across our industry」），但 Delta 的「佔有利潤比例」預測更具攻擊性與主張性。(證據: DOW 2025-Q2 \"Strained profitability across our industry\")

- 低票價業者財務壓力（「financial performance of the carriers… catering to the lower-income customers have not been good… someone had to declare bankruptcy」）：Delta 將競爭者脆弱性視為提高票價與行業整合的驅動。可比運輸業者也指出整體財務健康不佳（JBHT 2025-Q3 說「financial health of the transportation industry is not great」），Delta 的表述將此作為定價與結構性利多論據。(證據: JBHT 2025-Q3 \"financial health of the transportation industry is not great\")

- 2025 國內與國際邊際表現相對（「this year, they’re relatively similar. They’ve converged on each other」）：Delta 報告國內與國際毛利率趨於一致。可比公司談國際貢獻率改善（DASH 2024-Q4 說「Improving」），但 Delta 把「收斂為同一水平」視為策略結果的成果。(證據: DASH 2024-Q4 \"Improving\")

- 明年夏季跨大西洋產能成長方式（「probably low single digits… very, very low single digits if growth at all in very peak months… slightly higher shoulder season」）：Delta 表示跨大西洋高峰月將採取極低個位數成長以謹慎管理產能。可比旅遊業者有預估溫和成長或價格改善（NCLH 2024-Q4 預估 Q1 定價成長 3.6%），但 Delta 在「高峰期幾乎不成長」的表述上更強調產能收斂與保守。(證據: NCLH 2024-Q4 \"3.6%\")

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

---

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

Limitations and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric?
Eric Green: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report we delivered solid third quarter results with revenues, margins and adjusted EPS coming in above our expectations. Revenues of $805 million were up 5% on an organic basis. The adjusted operating margins were 21.1%, and adjusted EPS of $1.96 was up 6% compared to prior year. As you will hear today, our business momentum is steadily improving, and we expect this trend to continue. As a result of this strong performance, we are increasing our guidance for 2025. I want to especially thank our West team members for their efforts and continued focus in achieving these results. Before getting into the details of our Q3 performance, I want to highlight two notable appointments, which further strengthened our executive leadership team. In August, our new CFO, Bob McMahon joined West. Many of you know Bob, and he has done an exceptional job transitioning into his role, already visiting several of our websites and meeting with many of you. I'm excited to have Bob on board and partner together to lead the next phase of West grow. I'm also extremely pleased to welcome [ Davis matter ], our new Chief Technology Officer, who also joined West in August and is tasked with accelerating our innovation and new product introductions. Our team looks forward to benefiting from his industry experience and expertise. Now back to the Q3 financial results. Let's begin with a review of the Proprietary Products segment. Revenues of $648 million were up 5.1% on an organic basis. These results were driven by HVP components, our largest and most profitable business. We have a strong market position because of our trusted reputation for high-quality scale and reliability. This business has continued to strengthen each quarter, and revenues increased 13% organically in Q3. Several factors drove the strength of HVP components. First, elastomers for GLP-1 has strong growth and now account for 9% of total company sales. We benefit from our long-standing relationships as we partner with our customers in this market, supporting them as they expand their GLP-1 franchises. We're also collaborating closely with customers who are launching a pipeline of new GLP-1 molecules and generics. And we expect this market to continue to evolve as there are a number of new early-stage trials seeking to expand the range of indications and treatments using GLP-1s. Second, in biologics. We're encouraged for their underlying market demand as ordering trends are returning to normal. Less participation rate for biologics and biosimilars is trending above our historical levels year-to-date of greater than 90%. The third driver is HVP upgrades, including Annex 1. Given our strong market position with our elastomers portfolio, we are well positioned to benefit from what we believe is a long-term opportunity. We are tracking ahead of our expectations, and we currently have 375 ongoing Annex 1 upgrade projects. With the robust pipeline of new projects and our ability to partner with customers to convert current projects into commercial production, we anticipate Annex 1 and related HVP upgrades to deliver 200 basis points of growth this year, up from our previous expectation of 150 basis points. We expect Annex 1 to drive continuing demand for higher-quality products as European regulators now require pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate their culture of continuous manufacturing improvement. West is well positioned to support our customers with HVP components and technical documentation to meet those requirements. We continue to work through our constraint at our HVP manufacturing site in Germany. During the quarter, we made good progress hiring and training employees in installing new equipment to expand capacity. These efforts, in addition to product tech transfers, will allow us to further leverage our investments made in our global HVP components infrastructure and balance production across the network, enabling enough to drive future growth. Moving to the HVP Delivery Device business. Revenues declined compared to prior year as expected, driven mainly by the $19 million incentive payment we received last year. With respect to Smart [ Gild ] 3.5, which is less than 4% of the total company revenues were improving profitability every quarter by driving down costs and remain on track to go live with automation in early 2026, even as we continue to evaluate options to maximize the value of this business. Lastly, our Standard Products business increased 3.6% on an organic basis this quarter. Converting standard products to HVP components over time serves as an important funnel for our business by generating revenue and expanding margins. Turning to Contract Manufacturing segment. This business performed well in the quarter, delivering revenues of $157 million, growing by 4.9% organically. Moving forward, we are now utilizing our Arizona CTM footprint to consolidate operations from less efficient locations. We continue to expect the second CGM contract to conclude at the end of Q2 2026. The future available space is in an attractive location with strong operating team that is resulting in a number of promising discussions with multiple customers. Turning to our Dublin site. We continue to ramp production of delivery devices for the obesity market. We are currently validating and testing the equipment installed for the commercialization of our drug handling business in early 2026. GLP-1s is in the Contract Manufacturing segment accounts for 8% of total company sales. Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance of both the proprietary products and contract manufacturing segments along with the trends that we are seeing in our business and in the markets. Now I will turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert McMahon: Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here, and I'm pleased to be part of the West team. West team. West's Injectable Solutions and Services business is second to none, and I'm excited about the long-term growth potential of the company. Now before getting into the details, I wanted to highlight that we have revamped our quarterly presentation to provide some supplemental segment information, which we may find useful going forward. Now on to the quarterly results. In my remarks this morning, I'll provide some additional details on revenue as well as take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full year and fourth quarter guidance. As Eric mentioned, third quarter revenue was $805 million, above the top end of our revenue guidance, beating our expectations. On a reported basis, total revenues increased 7.7%. Currency had a positive impact of 2.7 percentage points, resulting in organic growth of 5.0%. Of note, the incentive fee reduced organic growth by 280 basis points. So a solid result overall. I'll now go through each of our businesses in more detail. Within the proprietary segment, HPV components, our largest business, accounting for 48% of total company sales was the standout. Revenues of $390 million increased 13.3% organically. This was driven by robust growth in GLP-1s, HVP upgrades, including Annex 1, improving performance in biologics and a normalizing demand environment. We are very pleased with the continued momentum in this business this year. In our HVP delivery devices business, which accounted for 12% of the company's net sales in the quarter, revenues were $99 million. This was down 16.7% year-on-year organically, but roughly flat sequentially as we expected. In Standard Products, revenues of $158 million increased 3.6% on an organic basis, even as we saw Annex 1 accelerate. Standard products accounted for 20% of total company net sales this quarter. Now looking across our end markets for proprietary. Biologics revenue was $329 million and up 8.3% on an organic basis. Growth in products using our laminated technology and strength in Westar and Envision offset the headwind from the incentive fee in the prior year. Pharma revenue rose 1.4% on an organic basis to $183 million, with growth in RU seals, stoppers and plungers. And generics revenue increased 2.6% organically to $136 million, also driven by growth in seals and stockers. Now finishing up revenues. Our Contract Manufacturing segment delivered $157 million, growing 4.9% on an organic basis. Segment performance in the quarter was driven by an increase in sales of self-injected devices for obesity and diabetes, partially offset by a decrease in sales of health care diagnostic devices. Contract manufacturing accounted for 20% of total company net sales in the quarter. Pricing was a positive 1.7%, and we are tracking at roughly 2.4% for the first 9 months of the year, right in line with our 2 to 3 percentage point expectation. Now let's take a closer look at the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 36.6% in the quarter, up 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. This strong result is due to the positive mix of HVP components, as well as good execution in our supply network. Adjusted operating margins of 21.1%, while down 40 basis points compared to the prior year were ahead of our expectations. And below the line, our net interest income was $4.5 million. The tax rate came in at 19.8%, slightly better than expected, and we had 72.6 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Now putting it all together, Q3 adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, up 6% versus last year and $0.26 above confident of guidance. Moving on to a few cash flow metrics. Year-to-date, operating cash flow is $504 million, up 9%, while free cash flow of $294 million is 54% higher than last year as capital expenditures are down 23%. To date, we have invested $210 million in capital expenditures and remain on track for $275 million for the year. In summary, we had a very solid third quarter operationally that exceeded our expectations. And as a result, we're increasing our full year guidance on both revenue and earnings per share. For the full year, we are now anticipating our reported revenue to be in the range of $3.06 billion to $3.07 billion. This represents reported growth of 5.8% to 6.1% and organic growth of 3.75% to 4% for the full year. The foreign exchange environment has remained relatively stable since our last guide and so currency is still expected to be a $59 million tailwind for the year. We are also increasing our full year adjusted EPS range to $7.06 to $7.11 representing year-on-year growth of 4.6% to 5.3%. A few more items to help you modeling. This assumes flat other income and expense, a 21% tax rate in the fourth quarter and 72.6 million diluted shares outstanding. In addition, we continue to anticipate $15 million to $20 million in tariff-related costs this year and now expect to mitigate more than half of those costs in 2025. For 2026, we expect to fully mitigate the impact based on the current tariff landscape. Our updated full year guidance translates to fourth quarter revenue of $790 million to $800 million. This is a reported increase of 5.5% to 6.8% and an organic increase of 1% to 2.3%. And as a reminder, we also had a $25 million incentive fee in Q4 of last year, which we do not expect to repeat this year and is reducing our expected Q4 organic growth by roughly 360 basis points. In fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $1.81 and $1.86. Before turning the call back over to Eric. And while we're still going through our planning process, I did want to share a few thoughts on 2026. We are exiting 2025 in a good place. We believe destocking is largely behind us and demand will continue to improve for our key growth drivers. That said, our end markets remain dynamic, and we could see a range of outcomes. So we will be prudent with our planning. Our HPV components business will lead the way given the multiyear growth drivers of GLP-1s and HVP upgrades, driving our biologics end market. We are anticipating the remaining CGM contract will continue to run at full capacity until exiting in mid-2026. This is roughly a $40 million headwind for the second half of 2026. We are actively working on refilling that space with higher-margin business with the expectation of the pacing and ramp, the pipeline coming in better view by the end of the year. Lastly, we are building out drug handling in our Dublin facility, and this is expected to add roughly $20 million in revenue for next year, which will help offset the CGM contract. And we will get back to expanding margins. So while early, I believe 2026 is coming into better focus, and I look forward to giving specific guidance on the next earnings call. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Eric for closing comments. Eric?
Eric Green: Great. Thanks, Bob. To summarize, we had a solid quarter, resulting in an upward adjustment to our guidance. We believe the positive trends in our business are sustainable due to strong execution, improving market conditions and our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers, our reputation for high-quality and services paramount. West has key competitive advantages that allow us to protect our business model long term, especially in our highest-margin HVP components franchise, and we continue to make progress improving our margins. This is why I'm confident that we are well positioned for Q4 and into 2026. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Knight with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Paul Knight: Congrats on the quarter. As you think about your long-term construct of 7% to 9% growth, are we heading there in 2026 in your opinion in terms of the momentum you're citing here in 3Q?
Eric Green: Yes. Thanks for that, Paul. And I'll start and then maybe ask Bob to join us in the conversation. But as we think about the key drivers to be able to deliver the long-range plan and long-term construct it really -- the thesis is really around the HVP components and driving into double-digit growth consistently year-over-year. And as you know, the key drivers of that for us are biologics or biosimilars, it's also the driver on Annex 1 and also GLP-1. So we feel good that we have the foundation laid that allows us to drive in the right direction to get to that LRP long term. Bob, do you want to give more color?
Robert McMahon: Yes. Paul, thanks for the question. As Eric said, the biggest growth driver we're seeing really nice momentum. As I mentioned on the call earlier, we've got some puts and takes here in 2026. But we feel good about the long-term growth of the business. We have to work through the puts and takes of some of the contracts that are coming in and out. And right now, I would say the street is in a good place.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Maybe just to follow up on that. The HPV components, as you said, a big part of the story. Really good growth in 2Q, continued that in the third quarter. Obviously, on GLP-1 and Annex 1 part of that. But could you talk about the sustainability of that being over double -- the double digits. You talked about hitting in the fourth quarter as well, but then going beyond just confidence in that trajectory? And then if I could throw on just a quick second part on the margin comment you made, Bob, about expanding margins next year. Can you talk about the new pieces of that between gross margin and volume leverage or your cost actions?
Eric Green: Thanks, Michael. And you're absolutely correct on the HVP components, I mean, the growth is starting to sequentially get stronger from the beginning of this year as we as we were looking at how the order patterns are becoming more normalized. So we're seeing the markets become more in line with what we would expect long term. We're seeing that with the order trends through our discussions with our customers. And another precursor for us, we keep a cool sign on as the bioprocessing space. As you know, that's a key indicator of what we should see and expect more near to midterm. We also are -- so we're confident in our position in biologics and biosimilars, particularly of the products in market but also new approvals that are in pipeline. And then Annex 1 is another key driver that has multiyear growth algorithm conversion from standard to high-value products, which is a -- it's a good opportunity for long-term growth to get us to that growth algorithm we talked about double digits for high-value product components. And Bob, do you want to?
Robert McMahon: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Maybe to add on the first question about HVP components. Certainly, we're feeling good about the momentum here. We're actually building to our Q4 guidance is low to mid-teens. So that momentum we're expecting to continue. Obviously, as we get into next year, there's some more challenging comps in the back half of the year. But that being said, the long-term growth drivers of GLP-1s and Annex 1 and the HPV upgrades are there. And that actually leads to your second question around the margin expansion. One of the things that I think we saw here in the quarter was just the beauty of that business being upgraded. The power of being able to drive more efficiency through the -- through the factories with the investments that we've made over time here as well as being able to provide more value-added products to our customers. I would expect that to continue next year. So when we think about opportunities, I do expect gross margin to be an area of opportunity for us to expand margins. But we're also looking at how do we ensure that we're also driving efficiencies kind of below the gross margin level as well. So I'd say it's both. But certainly, as HVP drives the growth that's -- we generate a mix benefit as well. So very nice from that standpoint.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Maybe one quick one on the CDM contract. It sounds like -- kind of the exited mid-'26. I appreciate the commentary there, Bob, on the $40 million headwind. I guess in terms of the visibility and fulfilling that with high-margin business, it sounds like -- what are the conversations there? What would the timing look like in terms of the backfill? How big of a gap would there be? And then maybe secondarily, just following up on Mike's question there, Bob, I know you spent a lot of time thinking about the margin opportunity here, where there's opportunities, whether it's footprint, higher utilization when you dug into the company here and look at the margin opportunity, can you just talk about some of that long-term stuff that you see and what opportunity you see on the margin, not only the mix to high value but also just more efficient operations?
Eric Green: Yes. No, it's a great question, Patrick. Let me -- I'll cover the first, and then Bob will address your second question. But in regards to contract manufacturing, specifically the CGM manufacturing we have in Dublin, we have a number of customers we're engaged with today that late-stage discussions to identify what would be appropriate business to replace the CGM business that we be exiting or finishing the current agreement until the end of June of 2026. So we feel good about the prospects. We do know that the economics of the future business. The expectation is to be stronger than what we currently have in that facility. And secondarily, there will be a transition period the second half of 2026. But usually, what you'll find is, as we extract the equipment for our previous customer and install new equipment, there's engineering fees that we incorporate into our revenue for contract manufacturing. So there will be revenues to replace the gap. And I won't say it's going to be 1:1, but healthy revenues and margin. And we expect to have commercial operations up towards the end of 2026 if it is a pretty straightforward process. So I'm feeling good about the prospects and now the conversations have been ongoing and very, very attractive business that we could put into that location.
Robert McMahon: Yes. And Patrick, on your second element of the question around our supply network. I think one of the things that I would say first off, is as we look at the footprint our ability to be local for local is a big opportunity and advantage for us for our customers. That being said, I think there's an opportunity in the medium and longer term to really optimize our footprint. And we're actually going through that analysis right now given the investments that we've made to kind of not only level load and fill those factories with check transfers across, but also the ability to actually drive more efficiency within the existing footprint. And I think that there probably is more opportunity to consolidate certain areas to drive even more efficiency as we go forward. That's not a 2026 element time frame. That's more of a longer term, which actually makes me feel good that there's not only some near-term opportunities to drive cost efficiencies, but also longer-term opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Markowitz with Evercore ISI.
Daniel Markowitz: Guys, congrats on the print and welcome, Bob.
Robert McMahon: Thanks good to be here.
Daniel Markowitz: Awesome. So Eric and Bob, I had a 2-parter for you. First, I'm curious on high-level headwinds and tailwinds to high-value components in 2026 as you see it today. As I think about it, I see a few tailwinds. One is that you're comping the destock, especially in the first half. Second, you have GLP-1s growing off of a larger base. Third, Annex 1 is accelerating following the uptick in project growth through 2025. And then lastly, you have this unique one-off customer situation that I think was about 150 basis point headwind to 25%, but should benefit $26 million. So wrapping up on this first one, is there anything else I should be thinking about as a headwind on the other side or anything I'm missing? And then the second question, zooming in on one of those on GLP-1 elastomer growth, it was mid-single-digit percent of sales in 2024, and now it's been climbing pretty steadily to now about 9% of total revs. That implies a pretty healthy growth for GLP-1s in 2025. Is it right to think it's more than like 50% growth? And if so, what's causing that, should we expect sustained over 20% growth over the next few years? Thank you and sorry for being long-winded.
Robert McMahon: Yes. I'll verify your math, Dan. We've been very pleased with the growth in GLP-1. And I'll turn it over to Eric to actually give some of the color commentary on what's been driving that. But I think it's important to understand that we expect that GLP-1s, while they may not be growing at that level, given the law of large numbers coming into next year, we are expecting very healthy growth in GLP-1 next year given the kind of underlying market dynamics there, Eric?
Eric Green: Yes, that's an excellent question. So as we think about the key drivers for other product components, you're absolutely correct that GLP-1s will continue to grow over seeing even -- as you think of long term with the potential introduction of orals into the equation, we do think the market itself will be a healthy blend of injectables and orals with injectables continue to be the larger portion, but the overall market continues to grow quite nicely based on what we are hearing from our customers, but also other sources. So we're very well positioned with GLP-1s. As you remember, this is -- this is leveraging our high-value product manufacturing plants. We have five across the globe. And it's -- so we do have scale. We do have the portfolio that supports our customers in that area. You commented about the timing of potential headwinds. I think the one area I would say is on Annex 1 while we have really good momentum in our contamination control strategy, working with our customers is really resonating. And as you know, this is really converting our standard products that are on drug molecules in commercial today to high-value products. And the economics for us is very attractive. As you know, our averages for standard products are margins in the 20% to 30% range, while the HVP is 60-plus percent. And so it's -- but the timing on how these projects roll off into commercial revenues do vary from client to client. And so that -- I wouldn't say it's a headwind. It's more of a timing from quarter-to-quarter, but we're really optimistic and confident in the pipeline that we're currently working on, but also know that we're only touching a fraction of the 6 billion components, we believe, is the market opportunity here. I think the other area is just, again, timing of new drug molecules approved in market. If you kind of look at last year to this year, a number of approvals by the FDA might be a little bit lower for various reasons. But as we are planning with our customers of future launches, the timing might be a little bit on certain launches. Now saying that, the growth levers that you mentioned earlier about biologics, biosimilars, GLP-1s and Annex 1 are very favorable. And those are the tailwinds that we're moving to the balance of this year and into next year.
Robert McMahon: Daniel, just maybe one other thing to follow up on your initial question around GLP-1s. Obviously, we watch that very closely and feel that our growth is largely in line with the growth that the end market is seeing as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with UBS.
Daniel Leonard: Thank you and Bob, you might have addressed my question right there, but I have a follow-up on GLP-1. It does seem like from the script data for Novo and Lilly that you're growing a lot faster than the market is growing. I wonder if there's a way to reconcile that. Could there be a compound or element here? Is it the clinical trial participation you alluded to? Any thoughts would be appreciated.
Eric Green: Yes, Dan, this is Eric. You're touching on exactly the areas. So if you think about we're starting to see an increase in vials. So therefore, our stockers and seals are necessary. So that's a factor when we think about our volumes and also the pipeline of new molecules being looked at and gone through clinical. So there's other factors that we're working with several customers. And also, there's a couple of geographies. There's an element around generics that were also able to support. So overall, it's -- I would say it's a little bit broader than just the scripts data of our two customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank.
Justin Bowers: Good morning everyone, and first, I appreciate the increase detail and transparency on some of the disclosures this quarter. So a 2-parter for me. One, I just wanted to follow up on Annex 1. There were some updates earlier this year. And just curious how that's impacting customer decision-making and some of the conversions. And if that's been a catalyst for some of the acceleration we're seeing. And then part 2 earlier in the prepared remarks, you talked about liquid handling in Dublin, being about a $20 million opportunity, plus or minus. Is that sort of the peak opportunity? Or is there room for growth there in that facility beyond 2026?
Eric Green: Yes, Justin, thank you for that. First of all, touch on the Dublin real quick. On the $20 million that we communicated. As we ramp up a new site, it does take time to get to full utilization. So I would consider this as early stages. And as we move into 2027 and a little bit beyond, that's when we get into our peak volumes and revenues. So the $20 million is really just kind of the ramp-up stage and then move through efficiencies through a few quarters, you'll start seeing the utilization significantly go up. So I would not look at $20 million as the peak revenues of that site for the drug handling. On the Annex 1, it's -- there are different factors. We do know that there are more conversations with the EU regulators with our customers as they are auditing and discussing about the regulations. Therefore, there is an interest to continue these projects on an accelerated pace. But again, as I mentioned earlier, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity of drug molecule that goes into Europe that we believe this is just really early stages out of the $6 billion components, it's a small fraction that we are currently converted to commercial at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CGS Securities.
Lawrence Solow: Great. I echo the appreciation on the transparency, and I also welcome, Bob. I guess I want to just follow up on the -- just on the gross margin, really strong this quarter. Just curious if you guys are actually seeing, and I think this has been part of the team too, just an improvement in mix within HVP and getting more towards the -- up and to the right until the NovaPure and higher-margin HVP components. Are you seeing that dynamic continue as well?
Robert McMahon: Larry, I appreciate the feedback. And to your question on gross margin, yes, that certainly is an element of it. When you look at our gross margin despite the incentive fee, we were actually up year-on-year 120 basis points. That was up almost 300 basis points. If you take that out kind of on a like-for-like basis and really the proprietary business, our HVP component business drove that. So what we're seeing is not only the investments that we made over the last couple of years being able to be filled and that capacity driving and you can imagine with the fixed installed base, the incremental margins are quite nice from that standpoint as it goes through the factory. But then as you're having these higher-value products there, you're driving higher ASP products through the facilities. And I think you see that, that's a very positive mix standpoint. The team has also done a very good job of driving down costs and driving up efficiencies. If I think about scrap and our yields, those are also areas of focus that the teams are really driving and I think as we talked about earlier, I think that we've got a multiyear opportunity from that standpoint. And then also, one of the areas is around also being much more focused on some of the raw material input costs. We're building out capabilities in our sourcing organization, working closely with our supply chain as well as streamlining some of the production traveling of our -- some of our products before they get to customers. So there's a number of elements, I think, that are in the next several years that I feel that we have an opportunity to continue to drive that gross margin opportunity
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.
Douglas Schenkel: Two quick topics I want to touch on. One is just a question on Q4 guidance and then one is on really visibility heading into next year. So on the fourth quarter, I want to confirm that you essentially bumped up guidance by the magnitude of the revenue beat. And if so, were there any timing dynamics in the third quarter that held you back from bumping up guidance more? Or was this just trying to be conservative in a period of continued uncertainty. So that's the first topic. The second is risk and visibility as a topic. So part of the attraction for a long time of West for investors has been that this has been a great sleep at night story, a steady compounder last year, with that in mind, I think the company and certainly the investment community were surprised by the roll-off of the incentive payments and drug delivery and also the changes in contract manufacturing. How would you characterize anything resembling that category of risk heading into year-end? I would guess you feel pretty good about it, but I just want to give you an opportunity to kind of tell us where we should all feel better about this getting back to be in the old West again?
Robert McMahon: Yes, I'll start, Doug, and on the Q4 guidance, don't read anything into that. We don't believe that there was any material pull forward when we look at it, actually, if you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, Q4 is actually an acceleration but there's also an element of prudence that even given the market dynamics outside that we want to make sure that we feel good about that, and we do. And so we've got some good momentum there and I'll just leave it at that. Maybe I'll start with the second piece and then turn it over to Eric as well. I think this is an area that I'm focused on intently. And I don't want to declare victory just yet in terms of that. And we -- but we do feel good about some of the trends. I would say we have -- in our -- we're committed to improving and providing more transparency, which we'll continue to do over time. But the market is still dynamic. I think we are improving our visibility. But the market still has some variables that we're working through our business planning process right now, and that's why we wanted to provide some puts and takes to what we know today for next year. And I think the long-term trends are positive. It's the pace of when we get back there. And I'll turn it over to Eric to maybe add anything.
Eric Green: Yes. No, thanks, Bob. And Doug, it's a great question because that's critical for historically what has been consistently from a demand profile perspective, pretty consistent of the market -- the injectable market space. We believe, based on the work that we have been doing and Bob did touch on this, is that going deeper in the different segments with clear accountability and ownership has given us better line of sight of our markets, obviously, engage with our customers, getting closer to them, which we observed during the pandemic period, we needed to do more of. And I'm confident we're making good headway and traction in that direction. The underlying market conditions continue to improve, considering where we were a while back. But your point is we are laser-focused on making sure we are reducing those risks and increase in visibility. And also providing more of that lens as we engage in these conversations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mac Etoch with Stephens Inc.
Steven Etoch: Just one on delivery license, relatively flat year-over-year, excluding the incentive fee. And I think you highlighted some improving economics ahead of the automated line coming on in 2026. So, can you just highlight some of the various aspects driving performance during the quarter and the variables that you're seeing on the top line of margins as well?
Eric Green: Yes. No, absolutely. Thanks for the question. When we look at the direct delivery device business, the area look at it holistically, the entire portfolio, we have administration systems in that category. We have Crystal Zenith and obviously, injectable devices like SmartDose. And I'm really pleased with the progress we're going to have throughout the year for our Crystal Zenith and also our admin systems. The area of focus has been on SmartDose to drive two levers with urgency. One is to drive down costs and improve efficiencies. And that -- the progress the team has made is on track with our expectations for this year, and we're seeing an improved margin performance or profitability quarter-over-quarter. There's more to come. With the automation that we are -- kind of being commercializing in early 2026, we're just going through the validation process as we speak. And we're confident that we'll be able to drive even more cost out of the -- out of the product itself. The second is to continue to look at alternative options to create even more value. with that product. And we will communicate once we can, but the final decision, but we're making progress in both areas.
Robert McMahon: Yes. And I would just add, Mac, on that. If you look at it on a quarterly basis sequentially, is it where we expected it to. So we feel good about that and that work that Eric just talked about, we're looking at both of those paths with urgency and focus. And so I feel good that each quarter, the economics have improved in delivery devices, as we said in our prepared remarks, and there's more room to go, but we're also making sure that we're looking at this for the long term and evaluating what's the best value for shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair.
Matthew Larew: Kind of a 2-part question around your manufacturing network. So after a couple of years of pressure on free cash flow and obviously an elevated CapEx spend for you, you've had a significant improvement in free cash this year as CapEx has normalized down to around 9%. So Bob, you referred a couple of times the opportunity for network optimization, but there's then the balance of obviously customers thinking about regionalization of manufacturing, some of the policy dynamics and obviously, still significant investment in HVP. So just as you think about maybe that balance of network optimization versus making sure you have capacity available for customers. But how are you thinking about the levels of CapEx needed to support growth, that'd be the first part. The second part is there's been a number of recent headlines around pharma tariffs and MFN. And I realize your business is tied to commercial volumes, not necessarily earlier-stage R&D how tuned in are your customers to those headlines in terms of influencing investment decisions versus sort of -- the train has left the station in terms of realization of their manufacturing.
Eric Green: Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Let me start with the CapEx that we are -- we have spent. But you're absolutely correct. Our focus really is on the high-value product components with our five center of excellence that we have, obviously, in Asia, Europe and U.S. Fortunately, over time, we have built the capacity and the capabilities to be able to support our global customers from multiple sites. So as you think about being more regionalized, we will support our customers in all markets. We're very well positioned from an infrastructure perspective. You're correct. As volumes increase, we will need to layer in additional capital, but we do feel comfortable that we're going to be back to the 6% to 8% of sales corridor for CapEx, but heavily weighted towards the high-value product components part of our business. And again, the concept of the center of excellence giving us that network capability, but also more of a campus site perspective versus doing more greenfield. I'll talk a little briefly on the -- on the second question you posed, and I'll turn it over to Bob to add any comments. But you're right. That conversation is active with our customers in the sense of what can we do to support our customers to drive down costs to support them. One is continue to leverage our global network. So there are a few cases where we could do tech transfers to move from one location to another geography to be more co-located with their end market. That's one opportunity that we are working with, but those do take around 12 to 18 months to complete and then to commercialize. But also I just want to comment. The products that we provide, the elastomer components that we provide are critical to the drug molecule, and they are less than 1% of the COGS of the drug. And so therefore, our focus is how can we help our customers drive better yields and efficiencies of their fill/finish process by providing more of the HVP services. So in that sense, we are working with our customers to provide additional services to improve the yield output from our -- for our customers. So it's an active dialogue. But for us, we're seeing less discussion about price, but more about making sure we're balanced from our global manufacturing perspective. Bob?
Robert McMahon: Yes. Matt, I'll just add a couple of things. Obviously, that's one of the areas that's pretty dynamic when we talk about kind of the MFN here in the U.S. just recently, we haven't seen any change in our customer buying behavior. That's something that we'll continue to watch. But -- and on the other side, I actually think that, that's a potential lift of an overhang so that they can now move forward. And then the investments here that we're seeing in the U.S. we are seeing that -- we believe that's real. That's a multiyear kind of investment. But as we think about we're talking about kind of level loading, we've made a lot of investment in the U.S. for the COVID capabilities and capacity a couple of years ago. And so we're working very closely with those -- as those customers are building out additional capacity in the U.S. about this tech transfer that Eric was just talking about. So I think we've got good relationships with those customers. And I think we're well placed to be able to continue to invest. And I'll just want to reiterate what Eric said. We do think that we're going to continue to drive down our capital spend as a percent of revenue. but disproportionately invest behind our highest growth opportunities, which is an HVP.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tucker Remmers with Jefferies.
Unknown Analyst: I had another question on Annex 1. So talk about 2% contribution this year from Annex 1 projects. Can you break down how that split between those projects that are in a development or validation phase versus switches that have already been put in place and sort of hitting what I would call commercial production?
Eric Green: Yes, great question. I would say if we look at the entire -- at the end of Q3, the number of open projects that we're currently working on, and the number of projects that convert into revenues are less than 40% with having converted since the duration of this project or this move towards Annex 1, so that kind of gives you a feel of as we ramp more new projects and they're rolling up. And we did mention earlier that some projects could be 3 to 4 quarters and a few others could be a 6 to 8 quarters. So it does depend on the scale of the project and the speed that our customers want to convert.
Operator: And our next question comes from Luke Sergott with Barclays.
Luke Sergott: Just wanted to ask here about the capital allocation. The first one of the hat tip to the transparency on the -- and the deck is beautiful. So given that you guys have like a pristine balance sheet right now, producing a lot of cash margins going the right way. Free cash flow seems to be picking back up. So update us on your capital allocation priorities, favoritism towards maybe a repo versus more bolt-on M&A?
Robert McMahon: I appreciate the feedback. This is Bob. And you're hitting on one of the key priorities that I've got and talking with Eric and the rest of the team and actually just spoke with our Board about this I think there's an opportunity for us to better define and establish a capital policy. And to your point, with being blessed with such a strong balance sheet and our cash flows to be more active in using those cash flows to really drive the business. And so what I would say is stay tuned, but it is high on the list of opportunities that will help continue to grow the business over time.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Sweeney for any further remarks.
John Sweeney: Thank you all very much for joining us today on the call. An online archive is available at our website at westpharma.com in the Investor Relations section. That concludes the call. Thank you very much, everybody, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Limitations and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial results prepared in conformity to GAAP are provided in this morning's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Green. Eric?
Eric Green: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report we delivered solid third quarter results with revenues, margins and adjusted EPS coming in above our expectations. Revenues of $805 million were up 5% on an organic basis. The adjusted operating margins were 21.1%, and adjusted EPS of $1.96 was up 6% compared to prior year. As you will hear today, our business momentum is steadily improving, and we expect this trend to continue. As a result of this strong performance, we are increasing our guidance for 2025. I want to especially thank our West team members for their efforts and continued focus in achieving these results. Before getting into the details of our Q3 performance, I want to highlight two notable appointments, which further strengthened our executive leadership team. In August, our new CFO, Bob McMahon joined West. Many of you know Bob, and he has done an exceptional job transitioning into his role, already visiting several of our websites and meeting with many of you. I'm excited to have Bob on board and partner together to lead the next phase of West grow. I'm also extremely pleased to welcome [ Davis matter ], our new Chief Technology Officer, who also joined West in August and is tasked with accelerating our innovation and new product introductions. Our team looks forward to benefiting from his industry experience and expertise. Now back to the Q3 financial results. Let's begin with a review of the Proprietary Products segment. Revenues of $648 million were up 5.1% on an organic basis. These results were driven by HVP components, our largest and most profitable business. We have a strong market position because of our trusted reputation for high-quality scale and reliability. This business has continued to strengthen each quarter, and revenues increased 13% organically in Q3. Several factors drove the strength of HVP components. First, elastomers for GLP-1 has strong growth and now account for 9% of total company sales. We benefit from our long-standing relationships as we partner with our customers in this market, supporting them as they expand their GLP-1 franchises. We're also collaborating closely with customers who are launching a pipeline of new GLP-1 molecules and generics. And we expect this market to continue to evolve as there are a number of new early-stage trials seeking to expand the range of indications and treatments using GLP-1s. Second, in biologics. We're encouraged for their underlying market demand as ordering trends are returning to normal. Less participation rate for biologics and biosimilars is trending above our historical levels year-to-date of greater than 90%. The third driver is HVP upgrades, including Annex 1. Given our strong market position with our elastomers portfolio, we are well positioned to benefit from what we believe is a long-term opportunity. We are tracking ahead of our expectations, and we currently have 375 ongoing Annex 1 upgrade projects. With the robust pipeline of new projects and our ability to partner with customers to convert current projects into commercial production, we anticipate Annex 1 and related HVP upgrades to deliver 200 basis points of growth this year, up from our previous expectation of 150 basis points. We expect Annex 1 to drive continuing demand for higher-quality products as European regulators now require pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate their culture of continuous manufacturing improvement. West is well positioned to support our customers with HVP components and technical documentation to meet those requirements. We continue to work through our constraint at our HVP manufacturing site in Germany. During the quarter, we made good progress hiring and training employees in installing new equipment to expand capacity. These efforts, in addition to product tech transfers, will allow us to further leverage our investments made in our global HVP components infrastructure and balance production across the network, enabling enough to drive future growth. Moving to the HVP Delivery Device business. Revenues declined compared to prior year as expected, driven mainly by the $19 million incentive payment we received last year. With respect to Smart [ Gild ] 3.5, which is less than 4% of the total company revenues were improving profitability every quarter by driving down costs and remain on track to go live with automation in early 2026, even as we continue to evaluate options to maximize the value of this business. Lastly, our Standard Products business increased 3.6% on an organic basis this quarter. Converting standard products to HVP components over time serves as an important funnel for our business by generating revenue and expanding margins. Turning to Contract Manufacturing segment. This business performed well in the quarter, delivering revenues of $157 million, growing by 4.9% organically. Moving forward, we are now utilizing our Arizona CTM footprint to consolidate operations from less efficient locations. We continue to expect the second CGM contract to conclude at the end of Q2 2026. The future available space is in an attractive location with strong operating team that is resulting in a number of promising discussions with multiple customers. Turning to our Dublin site. We continue to ramp production of delivery devices for the obesity market. We are currently validating and testing the equipment installed for the commercialization of our drug handling business in early 2026. GLP-1s is in the Contract Manufacturing segment accounts for 8% of total company sales. Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance of both the proprietary products and contract manufacturing segments along with the trends that we are seeing in our business and in the markets. Now I will turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert McMahon: Thanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here, and I'm pleased to be part of the West team. West team. West's Injectable Solutions and Services business is second to none, and I'm excited about the long-term growth potential of the company. Now before getting into the details, I wanted to highlight that we have revamped our quarterly presentation to provide some supplemental segment information, which we may find useful going forward. Now on to the quarterly results. In my remarks this morning, I'll provide some additional details on revenue as well as take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full year and fourth quarter guidance. As Eric mentioned, third quarter revenue was $805 million, above the top end of our revenue guidance, beating our expectations. On a reported basis, total revenues increased 7.7%. Currency had a positive impact of 2.7 percentage points, resulting in organic growth of 5.0%. Of note, the incentive fee reduced organic growth by 280 basis points. So a solid result overall. I'll now go through each of our businesses in more detail. Within the proprietary segment, HPV components, our largest business, accounting for 48% of total company sales was the standout. Revenues of $390 million increased 13.3% organically. This was driven by robust growth in GLP-1s, HVP upgrades, including Annex 1, improving performance in biologics and a normalizing demand environment. We are very pleased with the continued momentum in this business this year. In our HVP delivery devices business, which accounted for 12% of the company's net sales in the quarter, revenues were $99 million. This was down 16.7% year-on-year organically, but roughly flat sequentially as we expected. In Standard Products, revenues of $158 million increased 3.6% on an organic basis, even as we saw Annex 1 accelerate. Standard products accounted for 20% of total company net sales this quarter. Now looking across our end markets for proprietary. Biologics revenue was $329 million and up 8.3% on an organic basis. Growth in products using our laminated technology and strength in Westar and Envision offset the headwind from the incentive fee in the prior year. Pharma revenue rose 1.4% on an organic basis to $183 million, with growth in RU seals, stoppers and plungers. And generics revenue increased 2.6% organically to $136 million, also driven by growth in seals and stockers. Now finishing up revenues. Our Contract Manufacturing segment delivered $157 million, growing 4.9% on an organic basis. Segment performance in the quarter was driven by an increase in sales of self-injected devices for obesity and diabetes, partially offset by a decrease in sales of health care diagnostic devices. Contract manufacturing accounted for 20% of total company net sales in the quarter. Pricing was a positive 1.7%, and we are tracking at roughly 2.4% for the first 9 months of the year, right in line with our 2 to 3 percentage point expectation. Now let's take a closer look at the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 36.6% in the quarter, up 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. This strong result is due to the positive mix of HVP components, as well as good execution in our supply network. Adjusted operating margins of 21.1%, while down 40 basis points compared to the prior year were ahead of our expectations. And below the line, our net interest income was $4.5 million. The tax rate came in at 19.8%, slightly better than expected, and we had 72.6 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Now putting it all together, Q3 adjusted earnings per share were $1.96, up 6% versus last year and $0.26 above confident of guidance. Moving on to a few cash flow metrics. Year-to-date, operating cash flow is $504 million, up 9%, while free cash flow of $294 million is 54% higher than last year as capital expenditures are down 23%. To date, we have invested $210 million in capital expenditures and remain on track for $275 million for the year. In summary, we had a very solid third quarter operationally that exceeded our expectations. And as a result, we're increasing our full year guidance on both revenue and earnings per share. For the full year, we are now anticipating our reported revenue to be in the range of $3.06 billion to $3.07 billion. This represents reported growth of 5.8% to 6.1% and organic growth of 3.75% to 4% for the full year. The foreign exchange environment has remained relatively stable since our last guide and so currency is still expected to be a $59 million tailwind for the year. We are also increasing our full year adjusted EPS range to $7.06 to $7.11 representing year-on-year growth of 4.6% to 5.3%. A few more items to help you modeling. This assumes flat other income and expense, a 21% tax rate in the fourth quarter and 72.6 million diluted shares outstanding. In addition, we continue to anticipate $15 million to $20 million in tariff-related costs this year and now expect to mitigate more than half of those costs in 2025. For 2026, we expect to fully mitigate the impact based on the current tariff landscape. Our updated full year guidance translates to fourth quarter revenue of $790 million to $800 million. This is a reported increase of 5.5% to 6.8% and an organic increase of 1% to 2.3%. And as a reminder, we also had a $25 million incentive fee in Q4 of last year, which we do not expect to repeat this year and is reducing our expected Q4 organic growth by roughly 360 basis points. In fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $1.81 and $1.86. Before turning the call back over to Eric. And while we're still going through our planning process, I did want to share a few thoughts on 2026. We are exiting 2025 in a good place. We believe destocking is largely behind us and demand will continue to improve for our key growth drivers. That said, our end markets remain dynamic, and we could see a range of outcomes. So we will be prudent with our planning. Our HPV components business will lead the way given the multiyear growth drivers of GLP-1s and HVP upgrades, driving our biologics end market. We are anticipating the remaining CGM contract will continue to run at full capacity until exiting in mid-2026. This is roughly a $40 million headwind for the second half of 2026. We are actively working on refilling that space with higher-margin business with the expectation of the pacing and ramp, the pipeline coming in better view by the end of the year. Lastly, we are building out drug handling in our Dublin facility, and this is expected to add roughly $20 million in revenue for next year, which will help offset the CGM contract. And we will get back to expanding margins. So while early, I believe 2026 is coming into better focus, and I look forward to giving specific guidance on the next earnings call. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Eric for closing comments. Eric?
Eric Green: Great. Thanks, Bob. To summarize, we had a solid quarter, resulting in an upward adjustment to our guidance. We believe the positive trends in our business are sustainable due to strong execution, improving market conditions and our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers, our reputation for high-quality and services paramount. West has key competitive advantages that allow us to protect our business model long term, especially in our highest-margin HVP components franchise, and we continue to make progress improving our margins. This is why I'm confident that we are well positioned for Q4 and into 2026. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Knight with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Paul Knight: Congrats on the quarter. As you think about your long-term construct of 7% to 9% growth, are we heading there in 2026 in your opinion in terms of the momentum you're citing here in 3Q?
Eric Green: Yes. Thanks for that, Paul. And I'll start and then maybe ask Bob to join us in the conversation. But as we think about the key drivers to be able to deliver the long-range plan and long-term construct it really -- the thesis is really around the HVP components and driving into double-digit growth consistently year-over-year. And as you know, the key drivers of that for us are biologics or biosimilars, it's also the driver on Annex 1 and also GLP-1. So we feel good that we have the foundation laid that allows us to drive in the right direction to get to that LRP long term. Bob, do you want to give more color?
Robert McMahon: Yes. Paul, thanks for the question. As Eric said, the biggest growth driver we're seeing really nice momentum. As I mentioned on the call earlier, we've got some puts and takes here in 2026. But we feel good about the long-term growth of the business. We have to work through the puts and takes of some of the contracts that are coming in and out. And right now, I would say the street is in a good place.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.
Michael Ryskin: Maybe just to follow up on that. The HPV components, as you said, a big part of the story. Really good growth in 2Q, continued that in the third quarter. Obviously, on GLP-1 and Annex 1 part of that. But could you talk about the sustainability of that being over double -- the double digits. You talked about hitting in the fourth quarter as well, but then going beyond just confidence in that trajectory? And then if I could throw on just a quick second part on the margin comment you made, Bob, about expanding margins next year. Can you talk about the new pieces of that between gross margin and volume leverage or your cost actions?
Eric Green: Thanks, Michael. And you're absolutely correct on the HVP components, I mean, the growth is starting to sequentially get stronger from the beginning of this year as we as we were looking at how the order patterns are becoming more normalized. So we're seeing the markets become more in line with what we would expect long term. We're seeing that with the order trends through our discussions with our customers. And another precursor for us, we keep a cool sign on as the bioprocessing space. As you know, that's a key indicator of what we should see and expect more near to midterm. We also are -- so we're confident in our position in biologics and biosimilars, particularly of the products in market but also new approvals that are in pipeline. And then Annex 1 is another key driver that has multiyear growth algorithm conversion from standard to high-value products, which is a -- it's a good opportunity for long-term growth to get us to that growth algorithm we talked about double digits for high-value product components. And Bob, do you want to?
Robert McMahon: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Maybe to add on the first question about HVP components. Certainly, we're feeling good about the momentum here. We're actually building to our Q4 guidance is low to mid-teens. So that momentum we're expecting to continue. Obviously, as we get into next year, there's some more challenging comps in the back half of the year. But that being said, the long-term growth drivers of GLP-1s and Annex 1 and the HPV upgrades are there. And that actually leads to your second question around the margin expansion. One of the things that I think we saw here in the quarter was just the beauty of that business being upgraded. The power of being able to drive more efficiency through the -- through the factories with the investments that we've made over time here as well as being able to provide more value-added products to our customers. I would expect that to continue next year. So when we think about opportunities, I do expect gross margin to be an area of opportunity for us to expand margins. But we're also looking at how do we ensure that we're also driving efficiencies kind of below the gross margin level as well. So I'd say it's both. But certainly, as HVP drives the growth that's -- we generate a mix benefit as well. So very nice from that standpoint.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.
Patrick Donnelly: Maybe one quick one on the CDM contract. It sounds like -- kind of the exited mid-'26. I appreciate the commentary there, Bob, on the $40 million headwind. I guess in terms of the visibility and fulfilling that with high-margin business, it sounds like -- what are the conversations there? What would the timing look like in terms of the backfill? How big of a gap would there be? And then maybe secondarily, just following up on Mike's question there, Bob, I know you spent a lot of time thinking about the margin opportunity here, where there's opportunities, whether it's footprint, higher utilization when you dug into the company here and look at the margin opportunity, can you just talk about some of that long-term stuff that you see and what opportunity you see on the margin, not only the mix to high value but also just more efficient operations?
Eric Green: Yes. No, it's a great question, Patrick. Let me -- I'll cover the first, and then Bob will address your second question. But in regards to contract manufacturing, specifically the CGM manufacturing we have in Dublin, we have a number of customers we're engaged with today that late-stage discussions to identify what would be appropriate business to replace the CGM business that we be exiting or finishing the current agreement until the end of June of 2026. So we feel good about the prospects. We do know that the economics of the future business. The expectation is to be stronger than what we currently have in that facility. And secondarily, there will be a transition period the second half of 2026. But usually, what you'll find is, as we extract the equipment for our previous customer and install new equipment, there's engineering fees that we incorporate into our revenue for contract manufacturing. So there will be revenues to replace the gap. And I won't say it's going to be 1:1, but healthy revenues and margin. And we expect to have commercial operations up towards the end of 2026 if it is a pretty straightforward process. So I'm feeling good about the prospects and now the conversations have been ongoing and very, very attractive business that we could put into that location.
Robert McMahon: Yes. And Patrick, on your second element of the question around our supply network. I think one of the things that I would say first off, is as we look at the footprint our ability to be local for local is a big opportunity and advantage for us for our customers. That being said, I think there's an opportunity in the medium and longer term to really optimize our footprint. And we're actually going through that analysis right now given the investments that we've made to kind of not only level load and fill those factories with check transfers across, but also the ability to actually drive more efficiency within the existing footprint. And I think that there probably is more opportunity to consolidate certain areas to drive even more efficiency as we go forward. That's not a 2026 element time frame. That's more of a longer term, which actually makes me feel good that there's not only some near-term opportunities to drive cost efficiencies, but also longer-term opportunities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Markowitz with Evercore ISI.
Daniel Markowitz: Guys, congrats on the print and welcome, Bob.
Robert McMahon: Thanks good to be here.
Daniel Markowitz: Awesome. So Eric and Bob, I had a 2-parter for you. First, I'm curious on high-level headwinds and tailwinds to high-value components in 2026 as you see it today. As I think about it, I see a few tailwinds. One is that you're comping the destock, especially in the first half. Second, you have GLP-1s growing off of a larger base. Third, Annex 1 is accelerating following the uptick in project growth through 2025. And then lastly, you have this unique one-off customer situation that I think was about 150 basis point headwind to 25%, but should benefit $26 million. So wrapping up on this first one, is there anything else I should be thinking about as a headwind on the other side or anything I'm missing? And then the second question, zooming in on one of those on GLP-1 elastomer growth, it was mid-single-digit percent of sales in 2024, and now it's been climbing pretty steadily to now about 9% of total revs. That implies a pretty healthy growth for GLP-1s in 2025. Is it right to think it's more than like 50% growth? And if so, what's causing that, should we expect sustained over 20% growth over the next few years? Thank you and sorry for being long-winded.
Robert McMahon: Yes. I'll verify your math, Dan. We've been very pleased with the growth in GLP-1. And I'll turn it over to Eric to actually give some of the color commentary on what's been driving that. But I think it's important to understand that we expect that GLP-1s, while they may not be growing at that level, given the law of large numbers coming into next year, we are expecting very healthy growth in GLP-1 next year given the kind of underlying market dynamics there, Eric?
Eric Green: Yes, that's an excellent question. So as we think about the key drivers for other product components, you're absolutely correct that GLP-1s will continue to grow over seeing even -- as you think of long term with the potential introduction of orals into the equation, we do think the market itself will be a healthy blend of injectables and orals with injectables continue to be the larger portion, but the overall market continues to grow quite nicely based on what we are hearing from our customers, but also other sources. So we're very well positioned with GLP-1s. As you remember, this is -- this is leveraging our high-value product manufacturing plants. We have five across the globe. And it's -- so we do have scale. We do have the portfolio that supports our customers in that area. You commented about the timing of potential headwinds. I think the one area I would say is on Annex 1 while we have really good momentum in our contamination control strategy, working with our customers is really resonating. And as you know, this is really converting our standard products that are on drug molecules in commercial today to high-value products. And the economics for us is very attractive. As you know, our averages for standard products are margins in the 20% to 30% range, while the HVP is 60-plus percent. And so it's -- but the timing on how these projects roll off into commercial revenues do vary from client to client. And so that -- I wouldn't say it's a headwind. It's more of a timing from quarter-to-quarter, but we're really optimistic and confident in the pipeline that we're currently working on, but also know that we're only touching a fraction of the 6 billion components, we believe, is the market opportunity here. I think the other area is just, again, timing of new drug molecules approved in market. If you kind of look at last year to this year, a number of approvals by the FDA might be a little bit lower for various reasons. But as we are planning with our customers of future launches, the timing might be a little bit on certain launches. Now saying that, the growth levers that you mentioned earlier about biologics, biosimilars, GLP-1s and Annex 1 are very favorable. And those are the tailwinds that we're moving to the balance of this year and into next year.
Robert McMahon: Daniel, just maybe one other thing to follow up on your initial question around GLP-1s. Obviously, we watch that very closely and feel that our growth is largely in line with the growth that the end market is seeing as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with UBS.
Daniel Leonard: Thank you and Bob, you might have addressed my question right there, but I have a follow-up on GLP-1. It does seem like from the script data for Novo and Lilly that you're growing a lot faster than the market is growing. I wonder if there's a way to reconcile that. Could there be a compound or element here? Is it the clinical trial participation you alluded to? Any thoughts would be appreciated.
Eric Green: Yes, Dan, this is Eric. You're touching on exactly the areas. So if you think about we're starting to see an increase in vials. So therefore, our stockers and seals are necessary. So that's a factor when we think about our volumes and also the pipeline of new molecules being looked at and gone through clinical. So there's other factors that we're working with several customers. And also, there's a couple of geographies. There's an element around generics that were also able to support. So overall, it's -- I would say it's a little bit broader than just the scripts data of our two customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank.
Justin Bowers: Good morning everyone, and first, I appreciate the increase detail and transparency on some of the disclosures this quarter. So a 2-parter for me. One, I just wanted to follow up on Annex 1. There were some updates earlier this year. And just curious how that's impacting customer decision-making and some of the conversions. And if that's been a catalyst for some of the acceleration we're seeing. And then part 2 earlier in the prepared remarks, you talked about liquid handling in Dublin, being about a $20 million opportunity, plus or minus. Is that sort of the peak opportunity? Or is there room for growth there in that facility beyond 2026?
Eric Green: Yes, Justin, thank you for that. First of all, touch on the Dublin real quick. On the $20 million that we communicated. As we ramp up a new site, it does take time to get to full utilization. So I would consider this as early stages. And as we move into 2027 and a little bit beyond, that's when we get into our peak volumes and revenues. So the $20 million is really just kind of the ramp-up stage and then move through efficiencies through a few quarters, you'll start seeing the utilization significantly go up. So I would not look at $20 million as the peak revenues of that site for the drug handling. On the Annex 1, it's -- there are different factors. We do know that there are more conversations with the EU regulators with our customers as they are auditing and discussing about the regulations. Therefore, there is an interest to continue these projects on an accelerated pace. But again, as I mentioned earlier, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity of drug molecule that goes into Europe that we believe this is just really early stages out of the $6 billion components, it's a small fraction that we are currently converted to commercial at this time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Larry Solow with CGS Securities.
Lawrence Solow: Great. I echo the appreciation on the transparency, and I also welcome, Bob. I guess I want to just follow up on the -- just on the gross margin, really strong this quarter. Just curious if you guys are actually seeing, and I think this has been part of the team too, just an improvement in mix within HVP and getting more towards the -- up and to the right until the NovaPure and higher-margin HVP components. Are you seeing that dynamic continue as well?
Robert McMahon: Larry, I appreciate the feedback. And to your question on gross margin, yes, that certainly is an element of it. When you look at our gross margin despite the incentive fee, we were actually up year-on-year 120 basis points. That was up almost 300 basis points. If you take that out kind of on a like-for-like basis and really the proprietary business, our HVP component business drove that. So what we're seeing is not only the investments that we made over the last couple of years being able to be filled and that capacity driving and you can imagine with the fixed installed base, the incremental margins are quite nice from that standpoint as it goes through the factory. But then as you're having these higher-value products there, you're driving higher ASP products through the facilities. And I think you see that, that's a very positive mix standpoint. The team has also done a very good job of driving down costs and driving up efficiencies. If I think about scrap and our yields, those are also areas of focus that the teams are really driving and I think as we talked about earlier, I think that we've got a multiyear opportunity from that standpoint. And then also, one of the areas is around also being much more focused on some of the raw material input costs. We're building out capabilities in our sourcing organization, working closely with our supply chain as well as streamlining some of the production traveling of our -- some of our products before they get to customers. So there's a number of elements, I think, that are in the next several years that I feel that we have an opportunity to continue to drive that gross margin opportunity
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.
Douglas Schenkel: Two quick topics I want to touch on. One is just a question on Q4 guidance and then one is on really visibility heading into next year. So on the fourth quarter, I want to confirm that you essentially bumped up guidance by the magnitude of the revenue beat. And if so, were there any timing dynamics in the third quarter that held you back from bumping up guidance more? Or was this just trying to be conservative in a period of continued uncertainty. So that's the first topic. The second is risk and visibility as a topic. So part of the attraction for a long time of West for investors has been that this has been a great sleep at night story, a steady compounder last year, with that in mind, I think the company and certainly the investment community were surprised by the roll-off of the incentive payments and drug delivery and also the changes in contract manufacturing. How would you characterize anything resembling that category of risk heading into year-end? I would guess you feel pretty good about it, but I just want to give you an opportunity to kind of tell us where we should all feel better about this getting back to be in the old West again?
Robert McMahon: Yes, I'll start, Doug, and on the Q4 guidance, don't read anything into that. We don't believe that there was any material pull forward when we look at it, actually, if you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, Q4 is actually an acceleration but there's also an element of prudence that even given the market dynamics outside that we want to make sure that we feel good about that, and we do. And so we've got some good momentum there and I'll just leave it at that. Maybe I'll start with the second piece and then turn it over to Eric as well. I think this is an area that I'm focused on intently. And I don't want to declare victory just yet in terms of that. And we -- but we do feel good about some of the trends. I would say we have -- in our -- we're committed to improving and providing more transparency, which we'll continue to do over time. But the market is still dynamic. I think we are improving our visibility. But the market still has some variables that we're working through our business planning process right now, and that's why we wanted to provide some puts and takes to what we know today for next year. And I think the long-term trends are positive. It's the pace of when we get back there. And I'll turn it over to Eric to maybe add anything.
Eric Green: Yes. No, thanks, Bob. And Doug, it's a great question because that's critical for historically what has been consistently from a demand profile perspective, pretty consistent of the market -- the injectable market space. We believe, based on the work that we have been doing and Bob did touch on this, is that going deeper in the different segments with clear accountability and ownership has given us better line of sight of our markets, obviously, engage with our customers, getting closer to them, which we observed during the pandemic period, we needed to do more of. And I'm confident we're making good headway and traction in that direction. The underlying market conditions continue to improve, considering where we were a while back. But your point is we are laser-focused on making sure we are reducing those risks and increase in visibility. And also providing more of that lens as we engage in these conversations.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mac Etoch with Stephens Inc.
Steven Etoch: Just one on delivery license, relatively flat year-over-year, excluding the incentive fee. And I think you highlighted some improving economics ahead of the automated line coming on in 2026. So, can you just highlight some of the various aspects driving performance during the quarter and the variables that you're seeing on the top line of margins as well?
Eric Green: Yes. No, absolutely. Thanks for the question. When we look at the direct delivery device business, the area look at it holistically, the entire portfolio, we have administration systems in that category. We have Crystal Zenith and obviously, injectable devices like SmartDose. And I'm really pleased with the progress we're going to have throughout the year for our Crystal Zenith and also our admin systems. The area of focus has been on SmartDose to drive two levers with urgency. One is to drive down costs and improve efficiencies. And that -- the progress the team has made is on track with our expectations for this year, and we're seeing an improved margin performance or profitability quarter-over-quarter. There's more to come. With the automation that we are -- kind of being commercializing in early 2026, we're just going through the validation process as we speak. And we're confident that we'll be able to drive even more cost out of the -- out of the product itself. The second is to continue to look at alternative options to create even more value. with that product. And we will communicate once we can, but the final decision, but we're making progress in both areas.
Robert McMahon: Yes. And I would just add, Mac, on that. If you look at it on a quarterly basis sequentially, is it where we expected it to. So we feel good about that and that work that Eric just talked about, we're looking at both of those paths with urgency and focus. And so I feel good that each quarter, the economics have improved in delivery devices, as we said in our prepared remarks, and there's more room to go, but we're also making sure that we're looking at this for the long term and evaluating what's the best value for shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair.
Matthew Larew: Kind of a 2-part question around your manufacturing network. So after a couple of years of pressure on free cash flow and obviously an elevated CapEx spend for you, you've had a significant improvement in free cash this year as CapEx has normalized down to around 9%. So Bob, you referred a couple of times the opportunity for network optimization, but there's then the balance of obviously customers thinking about regionalization of manufacturing, some of the policy dynamics and obviously, still significant investment in HVP. So just as you think about maybe that balance of network optimization versus making sure you have capacity available for customers. But how are you thinking about the levels of CapEx needed to support growth, that'd be the first part. The second part is there's been a number of recent headlines around pharma tariffs and MFN. And I realize your business is tied to commercial volumes, not necessarily earlier-stage R&D how tuned in are your customers to those headlines in terms of influencing investment decisions versus sort of -- the train has left the station in terms of realization of their manufacturing.
Eric Green: Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. Let me start with the CapEx that we are -- we have spent. But you're absolutely correct. Our focus really is on the high-value product components with our five center of excellence that we have, obviously, in Asia, Europe and U.S. Fortunately, over time, we have built the capacity and the capabilities to be able to support our global customers from multiple sites. So as you think about being more regionalized, we will support our customers in all markets. We're very well positioned from an infrastructure perspective. You're correct. As volumes increase, we will need to layer in additional capital, but we do feel comfortable that we're going to be back to the 6% to 8% of sales corridor for CapEx, but heavily weighted towards the high-value product components part of our business. And again, the concept of the center of excellence giving us that network capability, but also more of a campus site perspective versus doing more greenfield. I'll talk a little briefly on the -- on the second question you posed, and I'll turn it over to Bob to add any comments. But you're right. That conversation is active with our customers in the sense of what can we do to support our customers to drive down costs to support them. One is continue to leverage our global network. So there are a few cases where we could do tech transfers to move from one location to another geography to be more co-located with their end market. That's one opportunity that we are working with, but those do take around 12 to 18 months to complete and then to commercialize. But also I just want to comment. The products that we provide, the elastomer components that we provide are critical to the drug molecule, and they are less than 1% of the COGS of the drug. And so therefore, our focus is how can we help our customers drive better yields and efficiencies of their fill/finish process by providing more of the HVP services. So in that sense, we are working with our customers to provide additional services to improve the yield output from our -- for our customers. So it's an active dialogue. But for us, we're seeing less discussion about price, but more about making sure we're balanced from our global manufacturing perspective. Bob?
Robert McMahon: Yes. Matt, I'll just add a couple of things. Obviously, that's one of the areas that's pretty dynamic when we talk about kind of the MFN here in the U.S. just recently, we haven't seen any change in our customer buying behavior. That's something that we'll continue to watch. But -- and on the other side, I actually think that, that's a potential lift of an overhang so that they can now move forward. And then the investments here that we're seeing in the U.S. we are seeing that -- we believe that's real. That's a multiyear kind of investment. But as we think about we're talking about kind of level loading, we've made a lot of investment in the U.S. for the COVID capabilities and capacity a couple of years ago. And so we're working very closely with those -- as those customers are building out additional capacity in the U.S. about this tech transfer that Eric was just talking about. So I think we've got good relationships with those customers. And I think we're well placed to be able to continue to invest. And I'll just want to reiterate what Eric said. We do think that we're going to continue to drive down our capital spend as a percent of revenue. but disproportionately invest behind our highest growth opportunities, which is an HVP.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tucker Remmers with Jefferies.
Unknown Analyst: I had another question on Annex 1. So talk about 2% contribution this year from Annex 1 projects. Can you break down how that split between those projects that are in a development or validation phase versus switches that have already been put in place and sort of hitting what I would call commercial production?
Eric Green: Yes, great question. I would say if we look at the entire -- at the end of Q3, the number of open projects that we're currently working on, and the number of projects that convert into revenues are less than 40% with having converted since the duration of this project or this move towards Annex 1, so that kind of gives you a feel of as we ramp more new projects and they're rolling up. And we did mention earlier that some projects could be 3 to 4 quarters and a few others could be a 6 to 8 quarters. So it does depend on the scale of the project and the speed that our customers want to convert.
Operator: And our next question comes from Luke Sergott with Barclays.
Luke Sergott: Just wanted to ask here about the capital allocation. The first one of the hat tip to the transparency on the -- and the deck is beautiful. So given that you guys have like a pristine balance sheet right now, producing a lot of cash margins going the right way. Free cash flow seems to be picking back up. So update us on your capital allocation priorities, favoritism towards maybe a repo versus more bolt-on M&A?
Robert McMahon: I appreciate the feedback. This is Bob. And you're hitting on one of the key priorities that I've got and talking with Eric and the rest of the team and actually just spoke with our Board about this I think there's an opportunity for us to better define and establish a capital policy. And to your point, with being blessed with such a strong balance sheet and our cash flows to be more active in using those cash flows to really drive the business. And so what I would say is stay tuned, but it is high on the list of opportunities that will help continue to grow the business over time.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to John Sweeney for any further remarks.
John Sweeney: Thank you all very much for joining us today on the call. An online archive is available at our website at westpharma.com in the Investor Relations section. That concludes the call. Thank you very much, everybody, and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Supported outcomes (management comments confirmed by numbers)

- Management said adjusted operating margins were "21.1%, down 40 basis points compared to prior year" — confirmed: current 21.1% vs 21.5% in 2024-Q3 = –40 bps.
- Management said Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.96 and above guidance ($0.26 above high end) and that adjusted EPS was up 6% YoY — confirmed: current adjusted EPS $1.96 is slightly above prior snapshot $1.94 and the company explicitly reported +6% YoY.
- Management stated YTD operating cash flow is $504M, up 9% — confirmed vs prior nine-month $463.3M.
- Management stated YTD free cash flow is $294M, up 54% — confirmed versus prior free cash flow snapshot ($133.9M) and the YoY percentage cited.
- Management noted gross margin improvement ("36.6%; up 120 bps YoY") — confirmed vs prior consolidated 35.4%.
- Management emphasized HVP components leading growth (GLP-1 drivers) and showed HVP components +13.3% organic — this confirms a reversal vs 2024-Q3 commentary that HVP had declined by low-single digits.

Summary focused on bottom-line improvements
- Clear improvements year-over-year on key bottom-line indicators: adjusted EPS modestly higher ($1.96 vs prior ~ $1.94), gross margin improved (36.6% vs 35.4%), operating cash flow increased ($504M vs $463.3M), and free cash flow rose materially ($294M vs ~$133.9M). These changes support management’s statements that margins and cash generation strengthened despite a small decline in adjusted operating margin versus the immediate prior year quarter.

  - 過去可比：淨利 = 140,000,000（解讀為 $140.0 million）(2024-Q3)。
    - 比較：無法直接比較，因為當前未提供淨利金額。但調整後 EPS 與現金流的改善暗示底線表現相較去年有所改善。

Supported outcomes（管理層論述與數字確認）

- 管理層表示調整後營業利潤率為 "21.1%，較去年下降 40 個基點" — 已被數字確認：當前 21.1% vs 2024-Q3 21.5% = –40 bps。
- 管理層表示 Q3 調整後 EPS 為 $1.96 且高於指引上限 $0.26，並指出調整後 EPS 同比增加 6% — 已被數字確認：當前 $1.96 略高於先前年快照 $1.94，並公司報告 +6% YoY。
- 管理層表示年初至今營運現金流為 $504M，較去年增長 9% — 已被數字確認（對比 2024 年九個月 $463.3M）。
- 管理層表示年初至今自由現金流為 $294M，較去年增長 54% — 已被數字確認（對比過去自由現金流快照約 $133.9M）。
- 管理層強調毛利率改善（"36.6%; up 120 bps YoY"）— 已被數字確認（對比 2024-Q3 合併毛利率 35.4%）。
- 管理層指出 HVP Components 帶動成長（GLP-1 驅動），當季 HVP Components 有 +13.3% 有機成長 — 這確認了相較 2024-Q3 HVP 低位下滑的實質改善。

Summary focused on bottom-line improvements
- 關鍵底線指標呈現明確改善：調整後 EPS 小幅上升（$1.96 vs 先前約 $1.94）、毛利率提升（36.6% vs 35.4%）、營運現金流增加（$504M vs $463.3M）以及自由現金流大幅上升（$294M vs 約 $133.9M）。這些數字支持管理層關於利潤率與現金產生能力改善的說法，即便調整後營業利潤率較去年略低 40 bps。

Peers note:
English

- Q3 2025 Revenue ($805M; up 5% organic)
  - WST frames growth as modest organic expansion driven by product mix (HVP strength) and an FX tailwind elsewhere; emphasis on organic growth (5.0%) rather than just reported dollars.
  - Comparable evidence: AKAM reported Q3 revenue $1.055B, “up 5% year‑over‑year as reported” (AKAM Q3 2025), and HOOD reported “nearly $1.3 billion” driven by much larger year‑over‑year gains. Those peers emphasize reported dollar scale or very large YOY gains rather than WST’s focus on segment/organic drivers.

- Q3 2025 Adjusted Operating Margin (21.1%)
  - WST highlights a high‑teens/low‑20s adjusted operating margin and frames it relative to expectations (ahead despite small YoY compression).
  - Comparable evidence: PLTR reported a 51% adjusted operating margin (PLTR Q3 2025) and BAX reported mid‑teens margins (BAX Q4 2024 at 15.2%), showing peers vary widely; some highlight much higher margins or the effect of investments rather than WST’s “ahead of expectations” positioning.

- Q3 2025 Adjusted EPS ($1.96; up 6% YoY)
  - WST emphasizes EPS growth and that results beat guidance by a material beat ($0.26 above high end).
  - Comparable evidence: peers report different absolute EPS and growth narratives (NRG $2.78 Q3 2025, IT $3.53 in other quarters). Some peers stress larger % gains; WST emphasizes guidance outperformance as the headline.

- Proprietary Products Segment Revenue ($648M; up 5.1% organic)
  - WST attributes overall company growth substantially to Proprietary Products (5.1% organic), tying it to HVP components strength.
  - Comparable evidence: CRL’s manufacturing revenue example ($200.8M, 2.9% organic Q2 2025) frames manufacturing growth at a smaller scale — peers often present segment growth in absolute dollars or different organic rates.

- HVP Components Revenue ($390M; 48% of sales; 13.3% organic)
  - WST stresses HVP components as the clear growth engine (double‑digit organic) and large share of total sales (48%).
  - Comparable evidence: other firms that call out high organic growth (e.g., DXCM “20% organic” Q3 2025) emphasize different drivers or smaller share dynamics; WST uniquely pairs high growth with near‑half company share.

- HVP Components Growth within Proprietary Products (13% organic)
  - WST repeatedly attributes underlying momentum to HVP components (13% organic) as a structural driver.
  - Comparable evidence: peers like ZBH reported “5% organic in Q3” (ZBH Q3 2025) — WST is highlighting a substantially stronger sub‑segment growth rate than many comparables.

- GLP‑1 Elastomers Share (9% of total sales)
  - WST quantifies GLP‑1 elastomers as a notable, rapidly growing mix item (9% of sales).
  - Comparable evidence: peers discuss GLP‑1 opportunity size (BDX “$1 billion by 2030”) or incremental contribution (CAH “5 percentage points”); WST is more specific about current mix share versus peers projecting market potential.

- Biologics Participation Rate YTD (trending >90%)
  - WST signals participation rates in biologics/biosimilars above historical >90% — arguing sustained strength in biologics exposure.
  - Comparable evidence: BDX/CRL peers describe biologics as “over 40%” of revenue or “expect to grow” (BDX, CRL), but WST emphasizes a high participation metric rather than only percent revenue.

- HVP Delivery Devices Revenue ($99M; 12% of net sales; down 16.7% organic YoY; flat sequential)
  - WST acknowledges a year‑over‑year decline in this sub‑category but frames it as roughly flat sequentially (managing variability).
  - Comparable evidence: peers tend to highlight steady segment increases or single‑digit declines; CRL/others cite manufacturing impacts — WST is explicit about YoY decline yet downplays near‑term sequential risk.

- Standard Products Revenue ($158M; 20% of net sales; 3.6% organic)
  - WST positions Standard Products as stable, low‑single‑digit organic growth and a sizable 20% of sales.
  - Comparable evidence: VTRS and CAH report similar modest generics/standard growth (2%–4% ranges). WST aligns with peers on modest growth but emphasizes the share (20%) in its mix.

- Contract Manufacturing Revenue ($157M; 4.9% organic; 20% of net sales)
  - WST frames Contract Manufacturing as a stable contributor with mid‑single‑digit organic growth and meaningful share (20%).
  - Comparable evidence: peers report a wide range of contract/manufacturing numbers (CRL manufacturing $200.8M with 2.9% organic) — WST’s narrative stresses steadier, mid‑single‑digit organic growth vs some peers’ lower rates.

- GLP‑1 in Contract Manufacturing (8% of total sales)
  - WST highlights GLP‑1 revenue within contract manufacturing as already a material 8% of total sales.
  - Comparable evidence: CAH and BDX discuss incremental GLP‑1 contributions (CAH “5 percentage points”, BDX market sizing) — WST emphasizes current share rather than future potential alone.

- Total Q3 2025 Revenue Growth — reported 7.7% / organic 5.0% / FX +2.7 pts
  - WST separates reported vs organic and explicitly calls out a meaningful FX tailwind (2.7 ppts).
  - Comparable evidence: peers reference organic/reporting splits and FX effects variably (ZBH “5% organic in Q3”, AKAM “positive $13M FX”), but WST’s quantified FX contribution (2.7 pts) is explicit and used to reconcile reported vs organic — peers often report smaller or different FX impacts.

- Biologics End Market Revenue ($329M; 8.3% organic)
  - WST points to double‑digit (relative) strength in biologics end market (8.3% organic) as a key end‑market driver.
  - Comparable evidence: CRL/BDX reference robust biologics growth (“expect to grow”, “over $1B annual biologic drug delivery”); WST gives a concrete quarter‑level dollar and organic rate aligning with peers’ growth narratives.

- Pharma End Market Revenue ($183M; 1.4% organic)
  - WST reports largely flat/low single‑digit organic growth in Pharma, downplaying it as a weaker contributor relative to biologics/HVP.
  - Comparable evidence: CAH shows higher pharma growth examples (e.g., 12% in CAH Q2 2024), indicating WST’s pharma performance is comparatively muted.

- Generics End Market Revenue ($136M; 2.6% organic)
  - WST frames generics as low single‑digit growth (2.6%), consistent with conservative generics trends.
  - Comparable evidence: VTRS and CAH cite 2%–4% generics growth in peers — WST aligns with the peer range and stresses modest contribution.

- Pricing Contribution to Growth (1.7% in Q3; ~2.4% YTD)
  - WST quantifies pricing as a positive but modest contributor to growth (1.7% Q3; ~2.4% YTD).
  - Comparable evidence: peers cite pricing/volume dynamics differently (e.g., BDX 6% driven by pricing/volume in one segment), but WST emphasizes pricing as a measured, not dominant, contributor.

- Q3 2025 Gross Margin (36.6%; +120 bps YoY)
  - WST highlights margin expansion (+120 bps) driven by mix and efficiencies while acknowledging slight operating margin compression.
  - Comparable evidence: peers report a wide range of gross margins (GNRC 40.2% Q3, ALGN 69.7% earlier), so WST’s narrative focuses on the positive YoY margin trend rather than absolute high margins.

- Q3 2025 Adjusted Operating Margin vs Prior Year (21.1%; down 40 bps YoY but ahead of expectations)
  - WST acknowledges YoY margin compression but stresses outperformance vs internal/Street expectations.
  - Comparable evidence: HAS and BDX discuss margin moves in different directions (HAS adjusted operating margin 25.7%), showing peers may emphasize either expansion or investment‑driven compression — WST’s message reconciles a small YoY decline with an operational beat.

- Q3 2025 EPS vs Guidance ($1.96; $0.26 above high end)
  - WST underscores a material beat to guidance as evidence of execution.
  - Comparable evidence: several peers provided EPS guidance ranges and occasional beats (EFX guidance $1.87–$1.97, BAX prior quarters), but WST’s explicit $0.26 above the high end is a stronger guidance‑beat framing than many peers’ commentary.

- YTD 2025 Operating Cash Flow ($504M; up 9% YoY)
  - WST presents improving cash conversion (operating cash flow +9% YTD) to support the quality of results.
  - Comparable evidence: peers’ YTD OCF vary (ULTA $302M YTD; HAS $588M YTD), and some peers emphasize larger absolute cash generation; WST focuses on steady improvement rather than absolute scale.

- YTD 2025 Free Cash Flow ($294M; up 54% YoY)
  - WST highlights a substantial YoY FCF improvement (54%) to underline cash discipline and operational leverage.
  - Comparable evidence: peers show diverse FCF outcomes (IEX $147M, ZBRA $288M YTD); WST emphasizes the percentage improvement as a key message.

- 2025 Full‑Year Revenue Guidance ($3.06–$3.07B; 5.8–6.1% reported; 3.75–4% organic)
  - WST provides a narrow full‑year revenue range and distinguishes reported vs organic growth, signaling conservative, measured guidance.
  - Comparable evidence: peers’ guidance ranges are often higher or at different scales (AKAM $4.135–$4.205B; DDOG $3.386–$3.390B). WST’s guidance is presented with explicit organic targets and an FX tailwind callout, whereas some peers emphasize reported growth or broader ranges.

- FX Impact 2025 (currency expected to be a $59M tailwind)
  - WST explicitly quantifies FX as a sizable $59M positive for the year.
  - Comparable evidence: AKAM expected “positive $13M” FX; ZBH described “flat to a 50 bps tailwind” — WST’s $59M explicit dollar‑value tailwind is relatively large and clearly communicated.

- 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance ($7.06–$7.11; 4.6–5.3% growth)
  - WST raises and narrows EPS guidance, citing mid‑single‑digit EPS growth and confidence in the outlook.
  - Comparable evidence: peers’ EPS guidance ranges differ (ALLE $7.65–$7.85; NRG $7.55–$8.15), with some peers at higher midpoints. WST frames its guidance as modest growth and tight range.

- Tariff‑Related Costs 2025 ($15–$20M expected)
  - WST discloses a relatively modest tariff cost expectation and treats it as a known, contained headwind.
  - Comparable evidence: peers estimate widely varying tariff impacts (HAS $100–$300M, ALLE $80M, BDX $90M) — WST’s $15–$20M is small by comparison and presented as manageable.

- Q4 2025 Revenue Guidance ($790–$800M; 5.5–6.8% reported; 1–2.3% organic)
  - WST gives a narrow Q4 range with low single‑digit organic growth expectation, while projecting stronger HVP lift in Q4.
  - Comparable evidence: peers’ quarter guidance varies widely (TTD example at $580M+ for a different model), but WST’s guidance is conservative on organic growth and explicit about reported/organic split.

- Q4 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance ($1.81–$1.86)
  - WST provides a tight Q4 EPS range consistent with full‑year cadence and with implied continuing execution.
  - Comparable evidence: peers’ Q4 EPS guidance examples span broader ranges (TEL $2.27, BAX $0.52–$0.57), showing WST focuses on a precise, narrow range.

- HVP Components Growth Expectation for Q4 (building to low‑ to mid‑teens)
  - WST forecasts HVP components accelerating into low‑ to mid‑teens in Q4, positioning this subsegment as a near‑term growth lever for the quarter and for 2026.
  - Comparable evidence: peers often call out segment acceleration but with different magnitudes; WST’s explicit low‑ to mid‑teens target for a single subsegment is more granular and optimistic than many broad peer segment calls.

- CGM Contract Headwind in 2H 2026 (~$40M)
  - WST flags a discrete future headwind (~$40M) from a contract exit and quantifies it for investors.
  - Comparable evidence: peers have disclosed varied headwinds (NTAP $55M ARR headwind; CRL “<500 bps” manufacturing revenue headwind). WST’s quantified $40M is within the range of peer disclosures but framed as a known timing/cash impact.

- 2026 Margin Trajectory (expect to return to expanding margins)
  - WST signals a plan to re‑expand margins in 2026 after near‑term compression — the narrative ties margin recovery to product mix and HVP growth.
  - Comparable evidence: EXPE and others project “further margin expansion” or moderated improvement in 2026; WST’s trajectory is consistent with peers but anchored to HVP‑led recovery.

- 2026 HVP Components Role (will lead 2026 growth given multi‑year GLP‑1 and HVP upgrades)
  - WST explicitly states HVP components will lead growth next year, linking it to structural GLP‑1 demand and upgrade cycles.
  - Comparable evidence: peers (BDX/CAH) discuss GLP‑1 market potential and multiyear drivers; WST is explicit about HVP components being the primary company‑level growth driver in 2026.

- CapEx as Percent of Sales (aim to return to 6–8% corridor, weighted to HVP components)
  - WST targets a 6–8% CapEx-to‑sales corridor and states spending will be weighted to HVP capacity/upgrade investments.
  - Comparable evidence: peers cite CapEx around “~5% of revenue” (TTD Q4 comment) or other levels; WST’s guidance is more aggressive/targeted toward HVP investment and explicitly ties CapEx to growth areas.

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

---

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Emerson.
Andrew Emerson: Good morning. I'm pleased to take you through our third quarter results and provide an updated outlook for our full year 2025 financial expectations. In terms of highlights in the quarter, IDEXX delivered strong financial results supported by outstanding commercial execution in our Companion Animal business with benefits from recently launched IDEXX innovations. Revenue increased 13% as reported and 12% organically, supported by over 10% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting over 8% gains in the U.S. and double-digit growth in international regions. We achieved another quarter of strong premium instrument placements, including over 1,750 IDEXX InVue Dx analyzers, resulting in 71% organic growth of CAG instrument revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Q3 was negatively impacted by declines in U.S. same-store clinical visits of 1.2%, driven by ongoing macro and sector pressures. IDEXX' operating performance was excellent in the quarter with comparable operating margin gains of 120 basis points, supported by gross margin expansion which benefited from strong recurring revenue growth. High operating profit gains enabled earnings per share of $3.40 in the quarter resulting in EPS growth of 15% on a comparable basis. We're increasing our full year revenue outlook by $43 million at midpoint, with an updated range of $4.270 billion to $4.300 billion, an outlook for overall reported revenue growth of 9.6% to 10.3%. Our updated full year overall organic revenue growth outlook is for 8.8% to 9.5%, with organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.2%. These organic growth ranges represent approximately a 1% increase at midpoint to our previous guidance, supported by strong global execution in our CAG business. We're increasing our full year EPS outlook to $12.81 to $13.01 per share, up $0.33 per share at midpoint, reflecting 12% to 14% comparable EPS growth. We'll discuss our updated 2025 financial expectations later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of the third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 12% was driven by 12% CAG revenue gains, 7% growth in our Water business and 14% gains in LPD. Strong CAG results were supported by CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 10% organically, including average global net price improvement of 4% to 4.5%, and benefits from CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues increasing 71% organically, aided by global placements of InVue Dx. U.S. organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues grew 8% in Q3, supported by solid volume gains and 4% benefit from net price realization. U.S. same-store clinical visits declined 1.2% in the quarter, reflecting an IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits of approximately 950 basis points, highlighting outstanding performance by the IDEXX teams. Q3 benefited from aging pets with non-wellness visits declining only 30 basis points year-over-year while wellness visits declined 2.5%. Health services continued to expand in the quarter, including increased diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit for both well and non-wellness visits as customers expand the use of diagnostics in their care protocols. International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue grew 14% organically in Q3, including approximately a 1% benefit related to equivalent days. Revenue performance was driven by volume gains, including benefits of net new customers and same-store sales utilization. International regions have sustained strong growth on a days adjusted basis for the past 10 quarters, highlighting the significant global opportunity as we invest in global commercial capabilities and expansions. IDEXX innovation and commercial execution also delivered strong organic revenue gains across testing modalities globally in the third quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 16% on an organic basis in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international regions. Consumable revenue growth was supported by expansion of our premium instrument installed base and expanded testing utilization including benefits from recent product launches. InVue Dx utilization is tracking well to our reoccurring revenue estimates previously provided of $3,500 to $5,500 per analyzer, and we're excited for the upcoming launch of FNA starting with mast cell tumor detection. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q3 compared to prior year levels. Total premium placements reached 5,665 units, an increase of 37% year-over-year. The quality of placements remains excellent, reflected in 1,203 global new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 347 in North America. Globally, we placed 1,753 IDEXX InVue Dx instruments as we continue to meet customer demand for this highly innovative analyzer. Ongoing progress of placing instruments combined with high customer retention levels supported the 10% year-over-year growth in our premium instrument installed base in the quarter. IDEXX Global Reference Lab revenues increased 9% organically in Q3, up approximately 4% growth from the second quarter driven by solid volume growth across regions, including expanded same-store volume benefits and net new customer gains. IDEXX Cancer Dx continues to gain further traction in North America reaching nearly 5,000 customers through October. Global rapid assay revenues declined 5% organically in Q3. Rapid assay results continue to be impacted by customers shifting pancreatic lipase testing to our Catalyst instrument platform, which we estimate to be a 6% headwind in Q3 revenue growth. Veterinary software and diagnostic imaging organic revenues increased 11%, driven by recurring revenues which grew 10% during the quarter. Solid growth in veterinary software was supported by a strong double-digit growth of cloud-based PIMS installations and adoption of related reoccurring services. We also saw continued strong double-digit year-over-year growth of diagnostic imaging system placements in the quarter. Water revenues increased 7% organically in Q3 with strong growth in international regions and solid mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 14% organically in the quarter with double-digit gains across most regions. Turning to the P&L, strong revenue growth enabled 16% comparable operating profit gains. Gross profit increased 15% in the quarter as reported and 13% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.8%, up approximately 80 basis points on a comparable basis. These gains reflect benefits from strong reoccurring revenue growth and IDEXX VetLab consumables and Reference Lab volumes along with operational productivity and pricing benefits, which offset inflationary cost pressures. Reported gross margin gains were moderated by 10 basis points of foreign exchange impacts net of hedge positions. On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year as we advance investments in our global commercial and innovation capabilities. Q3 earnings per share was $3.40 per share, including benefit of $14 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity. Income tax includes a $0.09 negative impact related to accelerating tax deductions for previously incurred research expenses allowed under the new U.S. tax legislation, which benefits cash taxes while increasing our effective tax rate in the period. Foreign exchange added $1.9 million to operating profit and $0.02 to EPS in Q3, net of hedge effects, reflecting a comparable EPS increase of 15%. Free cash flow was $371 million in Q3 and $964 million on a trailing 12-month basis with a net income to free cash flow conversion rate of 94%. For the full year, we're updating our outlook for free cash flow conversion to 95% to 100% of net income. This increase includes a 10% cash tax benefit primarily related to $105 million of acceleration of tax deductions for previously incurred research expenses allowed under recent U.S. tax legislation and a refined outlook for our full year capital spending of approximately $140 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We finished the period with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.5x net of cash. We continue to deploy capital towards share repurchases, allocating $242 million during the third quarter and contributing to $985 million on a year-to-date basis, supporting a 2.7% year-over-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding through Q3. Turning to our full year 2025. As noted, we're increasing our outlook for overall revenue to $4.270 billion to $4.300 billion. At midpoint, this reflects approximately $43 million of operational improvement, building on strong third quarter performance, including CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue expansion and increased InVue Dx revenue expectations. Our updated revenue growth outlook is for 9.6% to 10.3% growth as reported, including a 0.8% full year growth benefit and 2% growth benefit in Q4 from foreign exchange at the rates outlined in our press release. As a sensitivity, a 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce revenue by approximately $4 million and EPS by $0.01 for the remainder of the year. The updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 8.8% to 9.5% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 7.5% to 8.2% for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, including a consistent 4% to 4.5% benefit from global net price realization. At midpoint, during Q4, we're assuming U.S. clinical visits continue to decline at levels moderately better than the year-to-date average. We are again increasing our expectations for our InVue Dx placements, which we now expect to be approximately 6,000 during 2025, with instrument revenues of over $65 million as we continue to see strong demand from this exciting new platform. In terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook to 31.6% to 31.8% in 2025, reflecting an increased expectation for 80 to 100 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement net of 180 basis point operating margin benefit related to the discrete litigation expense impacts and updated foreign exchange effects. As noted previously, IDEXX remains well positioned to navigate the ongoing changes in the trade landscape with a largely U.S.-based manufacturing footprint. We remain focused on continuous supply to customers while actively managing cost impacts, which will continue to play out into 2026. Our updated full year earnings per share outlook is $12.81 to $13.01 per share, an increase of $0.33 per share at midpoint. Our EPS outlook incorporates increased projections for operational improvement of $0.22 at midpoint compared to our prior guide. We've also incorporated lower effective tax rate benefits, including $0.09 of share-based compensation activity compared to the prior outlook, partially offset by other tax impacts including the noted acceleration of research expense deductions under the new U.S. tax legislation. Updated estimates for interest expense, average share count reduction and foreign exchange impacts have also been incorporated, with additional details available in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.
Jay Mazelsky: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning. IDEXX delivered very strong financial performance in the third quarter while advancing our strategic priorities globally. Our proven model of high-touch commercial engagement, combined with differentiated testing and workflow innovations continue to drive adoption of IDEXX's world-class diagnostic and software solutions. These capabilities directly support our customers' mission to deliver the highest standards of care enabled through greater diagnostic frequency and utilization in everyday practice. Diagnostics remains the fastest-growing revenue stream within veterinary clinics, a durable trend reflecting the central role testing plays in determining patient health status and guiding treatment decisions. Our financial results in the quarter were underpinned by accelerating gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues across major regions. Growth in recurring revenues reflects multiple execution drivers, including double-digit growth of our premium installed base, instrument installed base, sustained strong new customer gains, solid net price realization and continued momentum in cloud-based software adoption. Importantly, these results were supported by continued momentum in our innovation playbook, highlighted by strong placements of InVue Dx, growing adoption of Cancer Dx, and benefits from the expanding Catalyst menu, including early uptake of Catalyst Cortisol. IDEXX solutions anchored by our integrated software-enabled multi-modality approach are well positioned to help clinics enhance efficiency, expand diagnostics reach, and deliver exceptional patient care. Building on the groundbreaking innovations we launched in 2025, and as highlighted at our August Investor Day, we will further expand our Cancer Dx franchise in 2026 with the addition of mast cell tumor and another high-impact cancer biomarker to the panel. We also plan to bring Cancer Dx panel to international markets starting in Q1 2026, extending its reach and accelerating our global leadership in veterinary cancer diagnostics. Our commercial organization again delivered outstanding performance in Q3. Across geographies, our teams drove very strong instrument placements with a high quality of placements supporting outstanding year-on-year growth of economic value placements, a key measure of future recurring revenue gains. Retention of our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue remained in the high 90s, reflecting the enduring loyalty and trust that veterinarians place in IDEXX. This loyalty is not simply the result of world-class products. It reflects the strength of our customer engagement and support model where IDEXX representatives serve as true partners in helping practices improve medical outcomes and business performance. In the U.S., growth was fueled by strong volume gains, including benefits from adoption of new innovations alongside sustained strong new and competitive Catalyst placements. Our teams are effectively engaging practices, whether start-ups outfitting their practice for the first time or established clinics seeking to upgrade and expand capabilities. Accelerated growth in the important diagnostics frequency metric as well as utilization per clinical visit is a critical driver of success, enhancing patient care while creating durable growth for both clinics and IDEXX. We are also benefiting from corporate account relationship extensions and expansions. These relationships represent significant multiyear growth opportunities as practices transition volume into IDEXX's ecosystem of diagnostic software and services. Importantly, these partnerships are increasingly structured to elevate care at the practice level, to greater diagnostics frequency, utilization, workflow optimization and expanded menu adoption. Internationally, we delivered double-digit installed base growth for the 11th consecutive quarter with the step-up in the growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth across major regions. Our commercial strategies are globally tailored to regional dynamics supported by strong Reference Laboratory networks and backed by an innovation approach that ensures high product market fit, such as with ProCyte One and SNAP Leishmania. Expanding diagnostic frequency in international regions continues to be a key growth lever, elevating the standard of care and expanding the sector opportunity. We remain committed to investing in our commercial footprint where the customer readiness and growth potential are strongest. We are on track with plans to expand in 3 international countries by the start of 2026, while also enhancing our U.S. commercial footprint. These are high-return investments, reducing the number of customers per account manager, supporting more frequent engagement, strengthening loyalty and driving adoption of IDEXX solutions. The commercial organization's ability to consistently deliver growth across varied geographies and macroeconomic conditions demonstrates the durability of our model. Practices continue to prioritize diagnostics and software because they are foundational to their mission, and IDEXX is their partner of choice. Turning to our innovation update, let me begin with Catalyst Cortisol, the newest addition to our Catalyst platform. Launched in North America in late July and at the end of the third quarter internationally, Catalyst Cortisol is already seeing strong momentum with over 1/4 of Catalyst customers in North America adopting test within the first 3 months of launch. This is among the fastest adoptions for Catalyst menu expansion, underscoring both the clinical need and the level of customer anticipation. Catalyst Cortisol enables veterinarians to rapidly measure cortisol levels at the point of care, supporting diagnosis and monitoring of adrenal conditions such as Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease. These conditions are often complex and require real-time insights to guide treatment decisions. With Catalyst Cortisol, veterinarians can deliver highly accurate results during the patient visit, avoiding delays, reducing callbacks and increasing confidence in treatment planning. The addition of Cortisol was the most frequently requested Catalyst menu expansion from customers, a clear signal of its importance to clinical practice. The rapid uptake we've seen validates the power of listening closely to our customers, and then delivering innovation that directly addresses their highest priority needs from both a testing accuracy standpoint in workflow friendly way. This is also a great example of our Technology for Life strategy. By continually expanding the Catalyst menu, we increase both the medical and economic value of the installed base. With nearly 77,000 Catalyst instruments and practices globally, each new menu expansion represents a lever for increased utilization, improved care and long-term recurring revenue. Alongside Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase, which has already achieved adoption across over 50% of the available installed base and Catalyst SmartQC, which is simplifying quality control workflows, Catalyst Cortisol is strengthening Catalyst position as the most versatile, value-creating chemistry, immunoassay and electrolyte platform in veterinary medicine. Moving to InVue Dx. By the end of Q3, we have placed over 4,400 InVue Dx analyzers globally year-to-date, exceeding our expectations in reinforcing the momentum that began with preorders last year. This represents one of the most successful product rollouts in IDEXX' history. This strong start gives us confidence to once again raise our full year outlook to approximately 6,000 placements. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with veterinarians consistently highlighting workflow transformation, diagnostic confidence and powerful clinical insight as the most meaningful benefits. The slide-free cytology workflow reduces technicians' time improves consistency and delivers results while the patients are still under practice. At the same time, AI models, now trained on more than 60 million cellular images, provide reliable, high-quality insights that elevate standards of care. Frequent software updates, as often as every other week, continuously expand these capabilities, enhancing accuracy and ensuring clinicians always benefit from the latest advancements. A great example of this is a recent update that reduced time to result of an ear cytology to approximately 8 minutes. Utilization for ear cytology or blood morphology has been robust and well-aligned with our expectations. Both of these broad-use categories have great use cases in everyday practice, serving as high-frequency diagnostics to support patient care across a wide range of conditions. Their adoption underscores the value of InVue Dx in addressing routine, repeatable testing needs to drive workflow efficiency and strengthen clinical confidence. Importantly, success in these initial categories provide a strong foundation for the platform, creating natural momentum as we expand the menu into additional high-value areas, such as oncology with the addition of fine needle aspirate, which remains on track for rollout later this year. Importantly, InVue Dx not only driving placements in consumables, but also strengthening customer loyalty and long-term contractual relationships. Many practices adopting InVue are expanding their broader IDEXX commitments with some extending agreements ahead of schedule to secure access to this transformative platform. Turning to Cancer Dx. Momentum remains strong with nearly 5,000 practices to date adopting these tests within just a few quarters of launch. Utilization is tracking well with expectations and we continue to be encouraged by competitive customer adoption, now over 17% of customers. This reflects growing awareness and underscores Cancer Dx' importance as a new standard in veterinary oncology. While the majority of samples are still being used to aid in the diagnosis of canine lymphoma, the number of practices incorporating the test into wellness protocols is nearing parity, enabling early detection and improved patient outcomes. The clinical need for oncology screening is clear. Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among dogs, and early detection is critical to improving outcomes. Cancer Dx provides veterinarians with a cost-effective, highly sensitive tool that integrates seamlessly into a standard wellness visit. Looking ahead, our Cancer Dx road map is ambitious as we expand internationally and have mast cell tumor detection in one additional cancer next year. With canine lymphoma and mast cell tumor detection, the Cancer Dx platform will address over 1/3 of all canine cancer cases. Mast cell tumors are top of mind with pet parents because they can often feel the lumps and bumps while petting or cuddling with their dog, and early detection can significantly improve the clinical outcome for an affected dog. The upcoming availability of FNA for lumps and bumps on InVue Dx will allow for cytology results during the patient visit, helping to provide clarity to a concern to pet parent. We have a couple of important highlights in our software business, specifically related to the broad-based adoption of our cloud-based products, reflecting the strength of IDEXX's vertical SaaS model purpose built for animal health. Veterinarians across all stages of their careers recognize the workflow efficiencies and ease of use that our solutions provide, enabling them to spend more time delivering care and less time on administrative tasks. Our cloud-native PIMS platforms delivered double-digit installed base growth again this quarter, surpassing a milestone, now with over 10,000 locations, and strong adoption among both independent practices and enterprise customers with multi-location groups. Customers are choosing IDEXX for our growing vertical SaaS platform where integrated modules create seamless workflows for clinicians and connectivity with diagnostics and increasingly for pet parents to Vello. Vello our client engagement platform continued to expand in Q3, with active clinics growing over 20% sequentially and over half of PIMS bookings in the quarter included a Vello subscription. Clinics using Vello report higher appointment adherence, increased diagnostics compliance and greater client satisfaction, all of which translated to higher visit volumes and revenue growth. The integration of Vello with our diagnostics and PIMS ecosystem further amplifies its value, making it an increasingly important part of IDEXX's long-term growth engine. As we conclude, I want to extend my deep gratitude to our 11,000 IDEXX employees worldwide. Your commitment to innovation, customer partnership and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver results like these. Q3 was another quarter where innovation and commercial execution came together to drive strong financial performance and advanced veterinary care. As diagnostics sit at the center of the veterinary system of care, IDEXX will remain at the forefront of advancing standards, unlocking practice productivity and driving sustainable growth. Now please open the line for Q&A.

Erin Wilson Wright: Great. I want to unpack a little bit the strength of consumables in the quarter and what's sustainable -- what's sustainable here. For instance, how much of the strength is actually InVue consumables, lipase or just the new contracting terms when you do place an InVue? For instance, you used to give us this metric back when you launched Catalyst Dx, that you used to say, with every Dx upgrade, it translated into a considerable amount of consumables uplift. I guess, do you have that metric when you're placing kind of InVue's, you're establishing and recontracting with new IDEXX 360 relationships? And presumably, this is an all InVue consumables contribution? I just want to unpack that.
Jay Mazelsky: Erin, yes, the growth in the VetLab consumables piece is very broad-based. So there's obviously the large installed base growth of 10%, and you can go back many quarters, and we continue to grow that very aggressively. And the quality of these placements is very high. We track economic value across the board; what we're seeing is high-quality placements competitive and greenfield is something we disclose both for chemistry and hematology, so you get a sense of that. Also the Technology for Life, the specialty tests, we've now had 3 within a period of a year. Those are -- those contribute. There's Pancreatic Lipase and SmartQC and now Cortisol. So these are tests that veterinarians prefer to do at the point of care, and that's clearly benefiting us. And I'd say -- by the way, it's, at an enterprise level, we're doing more testing in those areas. So this isn't a case of substituting from the reference lab to point of care. With respect to the InVue, I'd say that it's early stages. Obviously, it's all drop-through because it didn't exist before at the point of care and it's proceeding well to plan. And so that's an add, and as our installed base grows, we expect that, that will contribute greater amounts on a go-forward basis. But just to summarize, it's very broad-based growth across our point-of-care business.
Erin Wilson Wright: Okay. And then are we still on track with FNA and the launch? And what are you seeing from some of the pilot programs with FNA so far? And do you think there's this backlog of customers kind of waiting for FNA that should support another leg of growth here for InVue?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes, we are on track. What InVue customers tell us is that they -- there's very few customers that are just looking at one of the testing use cases, ear cytology or blood morphology or FNA testing for mast cell. They really are looking at as a broad portfolio tests that they would use. And obviously different mixes depending upon the practice and their preferences. So we expect that most of the customers, I can't say 100%, but the vast, vast majority of customers who purchase InVue for ear cytology and blood morphology will also use it for FNA testing. So we're very excited by that.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. [Operator Instructions]
Michael Ryskin: Can you guys hear me?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes.
Michael Ryskin: Yes. I want to follow up on some of your comments on end market business trending a little better. You guys continue to put up really impressive numbers. Can you hear me?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. Got you, Mike.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. Sorry. Just had some audio problems. You've put up really good numbers despite the end market weakness. I was just wondering if you could parse out a little bit, you talked a lot about InVue and the strength of that rollout there, whether you're seeing sort of the ability to leverage that for the rest of the business, the uplift you're seeing in consumables that will add consumables in the Reference Lab. Just sort of -- I don't know if I would call it a cross-selling opportunity, but just the ability to bring that into the vet clinic office, if that's leading to a stronger IDEXX premium and just ability to really drive the performance despite the continued softer macro? And I've got a follow-up.
Andrew Emerson: Thanks, Mike. This is Andrew. Maybe I'll just touch on your initial question on the sector, and then Jay may have a point of view on the portfolio side here. But ultimately, I think what we did see was the non-wellness visits were closer to flat in Q3. We did see some benefits from the pet population that was 5 years and older related to the clinical visits themselves. And then, as we've been highlighting, I think, with those adult dogs and cats transitioning to more seniors, we also see higher quality of the visits where we see expanded diagnostic frequency and utilization benefits with that as well. So that was one of the key drivers. What I would say is on the wellness side, we continue to see pressures from a macro perspective. We know there's still challenges out there just related to the consumers and the macro trends. Wellness visits did continue to decline, more about 2.5% overall within the quarter. So fairly consistent pressure on the more elective and wellness characteristics of that. We'll continue to monitor this sector. But to your point, I do think that as we think about the broader portfolio, there's really an opportunity to continue to play that out. We see Reference Labs tend to be a little bit more weighted to wellness visits, same with rapid assay. And so we do see a bit of a benefit in the IDEXX VetLab consumables, but I think there's an opportunity for us to continue to see benefits from the aging patients over time.
Jay Mazelsky: Yes, Mike, with respect to your question around InVue and its broader impact, we've always had, when we come out with a new instrument, it's a big deal. There are a direct economic benefits and there are indirect benefits. Obviously, the direct, you're placing an instrument that that's capital revenue and over time you build an installed base and the flywheel for recurring revenue. But most of these instruments get placed in some sort of marketing program, like IDEXX 360. And so the customer can satisfy volume commitments and is very often inspired to do more of their overall testing volume, including Reference Labs and rapid assay and our SaaS software solutions through us. And so those are the indirect benefits. And most of our -- about 2/3 of the InVue placements to date have come out of North America, 1/3 internationally. So we're excited. It does have some leverage impact, and we'll see more direct benefits, as I indicated earlier from just the recurring revenue stream of InVue.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up, you talked about investments a couple of times in the prepared remarks. Could you expand on that a little bit, between incremental R&D on future platforms and maybe to continue to work on Multi-Q Dx, I don't know how much you'll be able to talk about that, or the commercial sales force. Just wondering the strength that you've had in the top line this year, how you're flowing that through the model and just sort of what are your relative priorities for investment from that strength?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. I'll cover the investment piece and if Andrew would like to cover how we're thinking about the mix within the P&L., I'll hand it to him. From an investment standpoint, the way we think about it, there's commercial opportunity and sector development. We know that takes investments in reach and frequency of our sales organization. And so we're on track for the first of the year. They have 3 international and a modest increment in the U.S. We know these are good investments. These tend to be more of a short-return type of thing with a high confidence level because we have a playbook and a template in terms of how we think about it, and they fit well into our territories. And within 3 or 4 quarters, are trained and onboarded and very productive sales professionals. The ongoing R&D investments, these tend to be multiyear in horizon across the board. There's biomarker investment, obviously, that can be leveraged both reference labs and point of care, new instruments, InVue and Multi-Q Dx, those are ongoing and tend to be 4, 5 years. And then, obviously, the software piece is a critical part of our strategy, and we're investing heavily both in cloud-based PIM systems and Vello and the other software applications.
Andrew Emerson: Yes. Maybe just, Mike, in Q3 in particular, we highlighted 12% year-over-year growth in our operating expenses. So one of the things that we do always look at is how we're performing from an overall company perspective and making the right investments to continue to drive future growth. Again, if I take a step back and think about our longer-term growth algorithm, we constantly want to reinvest back into the business while still continuing to deliver solid operating margin gains over time here. And I think Q3 was a good example of our ability to do that. With higher top line growth, we were able to both contribute an operating margin gain benefit, but also invest heavily back into the business. And I think it's a really disciplined resource allocation approach to think about that mix across innovation and commercial and other support areas that Jay was highlighting that we want to make sure we get right.
Operator: The next question is from Jon Block with Stifel.
Jonathan Block: Maybe I'll just also start with InVue. The '25 placement guidance, I think I've got my math right, implies roughly 1,500 systems for 4Q '25. So still solid, and I know you raised the full year, but that would be down sequentially. You flipped from an order number to a placement number. So I guess the question here is, are you caught up with the orders when we think about where you are with InVue? And then just even any high-level thoughts on, I believe I've got it right, the initial 20,000 over 5 years. You're running well ahead in year 1 in totality. Any thoughts on the longer-term goals that you guys had put out? And then I'll ask a follow-up.
Andrew Emerson: Thanks, Jon, this is Andrew. So from an InVue perspective on the longer-term goal, we certainly are still focused on the 20,000 over 5 years. We haven't updated that. We're off to a strong start here and we're targeting 6,000 placements by the end of 2025, which is really our first year of launch ultimately. So we feel good about that 6,000 placement trajectory here, and that's well above our initial guide of 4,500 where we started the year. We've seen really strong demand for the platform itself. And I think we're going to continue to build on the impact that can have with FNA, starting with mast cell tumor detection as a great example of the extensibility of the platform overall. So nothing I would call out specifically. To your point, I think the math or the implied placement math that suggests 1,500 to 1,600 placements in Q4, and that's certainly still a very solid trajectory here, and we feel good about the trajectory that we're on for the platform overall.
Jonathan Block: Fair enough. And maybe I'll go to a different topic. I actually thought one of the most impressive metrics for the quarter was the international CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of almost 14%. I think it's the highest growth rate since coming out of or emerging out of COVID. And arguably, it doesn't really reflect much of InVue, no Cancer Dx. I think it's before the additional sales reps really take hold in the field. So it's always more limited visibility in the international markets. I know you've spoken to the increased double-digit in the installed base for 11 consecutive quarters. But there's got to be more than that even as traction. So any color you can provide there? And is this sort of the right run rate in the international markets, especially because you'll have those incoming tailwinds of innovation and sales reps going forward?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. So we're -- there's a couple of dimensions, I think, to think about from just an international opportunity standpoint. One is it's just more embryonic in terms of the use of diagnostics. And we have a tried and true approach from the standpoint of just developing the sector. And what we have found is it's very translatable to the international market. So obviously, the quantity of your sales professionals has a quality all its own. So being able to increase the sales organization. So it's important, and we've been doing that now for 4 or 5 years. But the other thing that I would just point out is the maturity of working within the system takes some time. So it's not just about the account manager or the VDC, it's about the full commercial ecosystem of the professional service and the field service representative and the inside sales then and all those working in a synchronized fashion. The other pieces that we've invested in internationally is the Reference Lab network and really building out a network that enables next-day performance. We've invested in software localizations like VetConnect PLUS, all of those pieces come together. In terms -- we just think there's an outstanding opportunity in the international geographies. We guided from a -- at Investor Day that the international opportunity is a couple of hundred basis points, I think, faster than the U.S. We feel good about that. We think that offers a pretty long-term horizon opportunity year-on-year that we can develop.
Andrew Emerson: Really great results in Q3. I would highlight that we did call out there's about 100 basis points of benefit related to equivalent days on the international business. So very significant results overall regardless, but we did see some modest days benefit in the quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Christopher Schott: Just a couple for me. Maybe just coming back on the aging pet commentary. It sounds like you're starting to see this supporting visits in the U.S. I guess is it fair to think about this point this now being a tailwind for the business as we look out to 2026 and beyond and start thinking about [ positive ] at least clinical visit growth or could this remain kind of bumpy in the near term? And just my follow-up was just on the international business and the discussion. Can you also elaborate on visit trends there? I guess we see a similar dynamic to the U.S. where the clinical visits are starting to pick up and wellness is still under some pressure, or is it more balanced in the international markets?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. I'll cover your second question first. We don't have as good visibility into clinical visits internationally just because we don't have the installed base of PIM systems, which allows us to access what is otherwise a very fragmented installed base of software. Our perspective, our market research suggests that it's largely stabilized from some of the choppiness we've seen over the last couple of years. So I think it's a stable environment, and we're clearly being able to execute against an environment that we think over time will improve. From the standpoint of the aging pets, the non-wellness visit essentially flat, we did see that adult dogs coming for more non-wellness visits. Some of that is likely pandemic dogs, designer breeds that are more heavily medicalized, larger breeds, larger dogs that get sicker earlier in their life spans, in terms of how that sustains quarter-to-quarter remains to be same. This is just a data point. I think what we could say with a good degree of confidence is that these pets, as they age from the pandemic and the large step-up that we've seen, will come into the practice more for sick care and that, from a clinical visit trend standpoint, it will be very positive.
Operator: The next question is from Daniel Clark with Leerink Partners.
Daniel Christopher Clark: I also wanted to ask on international, maybe in a little bit of a different way. On a days adjusted basis, CAG recurring grew at least 13% in the quarter. As you mentioned on the call, your kind of growth potential is 13% to 16%. So like what gets us up to the 15%, 16% range? Is it just continued sales rollout? Or what else should we be thinking about here?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. It's really all the pieces that I mentioned. We're going to continue to invest in sales force expansions over time. That's really a function of time and distance and maturity of the sales organization. We're very disciplined about that. We want to make sure the market is ready. There's a product market fit dimension that we evaluate expansions and growth. For example, ProCyte One, that was -- the hematology analyzer, really designed at the inception for our international hematology first markets in terms of cost and footprint. It's super important just to Reference Lab network. So we continue to build out our Reference Labs on a global basis, both from a European geography, but also within various markets in Asia Pacific, we know that, that's super important, and then making sure that the customer support or customer experience proceeds is ahead of the investment in commercial. We want to make sure that customers who may not know IDEXX and the first exposure to IDEXX, they get not just solutions that perform at a very high level, but the support organization is there in-country, supporting them when they have all challenges. We think all those things combined give us a lot of confidence that the 13% to 16% growth rate is achievable.
Daniel Christopher Clark: Just had a quick follow-up on visits. Last third quarter, you talked about 1% to 1.5% growth benefit to visits from launch of a different company's pain medicine. Was there any impact on headline visit numbers in the quarter as you've lapped that launch?
Andrew Emerson: Yes, Dan, I think just in terms of the metric that you're quoting, I think that was from the prior year. We had highlighted that we have seen some effect on clinical visits and the inverse impact on diagnostic frequency. Really what we're just trying to call out is the change in the metrics themselves and not necessarily an impact on our IDEXX business directly. And so there's nothing I'd call out or highlight as part of the change or impact that we saw here in Q3 related to that at this point. And again, I think we're in at least a clean view from both the sector metrics and what we've highlighted for the interim performance that we've had in IDEXX.
Operator: The next question is from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.
Brandon Vazquez: Congrats on a nice quarter. I'll just ask 1 here because we're coming up on time. But you highlighted the ability to get into some competitive accounts with Cancer Dx. Just curious, given on the Reference Lab side, given there's a lot of contracts there, what's your ability to maybe use that as a foot in the door and start taking share, even more share, within that market? So just talk a little bit about what that commercial process can look like and how long that might take given you're kind of opening new doors there?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. Brandon, our reference portfolio is very broad and differentiated. Clearly, that's a point that Cancer Dx test is a point of differentiation and having approximately 17% of test submissions coming from competitive Reference Lab customers, I think, is something that is gratifying both from these pets getting a better standard of care. And also that gives us an opportunity to put our best foot forward and reintroduce, in some cases, the IDEXX and the IDEXX Reference Lab to these customers. So it's an important piece, but I think it's just a piece.
Operator: The next question is from Andrea Alfonso with UBS.
Andrea Zayco Narvaez Alfonso: I just have a question on Cancer Dx. You noted the 5,000 ordering practice. I guess just with respect to adoption in terms of the screening panel, are you able to frame at all sort of how that sort of thinking in terms of just general cutoff points as far as age and frequency, where there's sort of agreeing on a sweet spot? And obviously, wellness visits, you continue to lag, so how is the company engaging that as far as initiating those talking points?
Jay Mazelsky: Sure. There's 2 separate use cases for Cancer Dx. One is an aid in diagnosis. So these are typically dogs that come in, they have clinical symptoms consistent with lymphoma, and veterinarians are using this as a test. At this point, they represent the majority, but just bare majority of tests. And then the screening test that is more wellness screening, and that we think it makes sense for dogs that are 7 years or older, as well as breeds that may have a higher incidence of cancer. So we believe that over time, what we're going to see is we're going to see the test used it will flip. It will be more as a screening test, but also aid in diagnosis for sick patients, but that will be the minority of cases. The other thing that I would point out is, as the panel expands, so if you think about lymphoma, plus mast cell tumor detection, that represents over 1/3 of cancer cases in dogs. It becomes a much more compelling value proposition as part of a wellness screening. And we've also indicated that there will be a third cancer screen in 2026. So at that point, we think this -- it's sufficient in terms of menu comprehensiveness to really be seen by customers as an attractive screening test.
Operator: The next question is from Keith Devas with Jefferies.
Keith Devas: Maybe just higher level, just thinking about the thoughts on the pace of innovation you guys have done a lot, obviously, in the last year. There's more coming next year. How do you guys know you're not doing too much too soon or too much that the market can or can't absorb it, macro environment is only slightly improving maybe from your standpoint? And maybe the second follow-up is, do you think the planned reinvestment plans that you have from this year and into next year is enough? And how you might course correct if things are a little bit better than anticipated?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. We're -- we think the innovation agenda portfolio is aggressive, but aggressive from an intentional standpoint, that it represents a set of portfolio solutions, whether it's assays or new instruments or software that our customers are hungry for. Clearly, our commercial organization has a very large footprint, and they're subject matter experts and they're able to digest these testing solutions and bring them to customers in ways that allow testing growth. So the opportunities abound. Ours is a sector development business model, and innovation is a key driver behind being able to develop the sector. And so with that, we'll now conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for your participation and engagement this morning. It's once again my pleasure to share IDEXX executed against our organic growth strategy while delivering strong financial results in the third quarter. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Original transcript:
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the IDEXX Laboratories Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Andrew Emerson, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our third quarter 2025 results and updated 2025 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions] Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of our website after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Emerson.
Andrew Emerson: Good morning. I'm pleased to take you through our third quarter results and provide an updated outlook for our full year 2025 financial expectations. In terms of highlights in the quarter, IDEXX delivered strong financial results supported by outstanding commercial execution in our Companion Animal business with benefits from recently launched IDEXX innovations. Revenue increased 13% as reported and 12% organically, supported by over 10% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting over 8% gains in the U.S. and double-digit growth in international regions. We achieved another quarter of strong premium instrument placements, including over 1,750 IDEXX InVue Dx analyzers, resulting in 71% organic growth of CAG instrument revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Q3 was negatively impacted by declines in U.S. same-store clinical visits of 1.2%, driven by ongoing macro and sector pressures. IDEXX' operating performance was excellent in the quarter with comparable operating margin gains of 120 basis points, supported by gross margin expansion which benefited from strong recurring revenue growth. High operating profit gains enabled earnings per share of $3.40 in the quarter resulting in EPS growth of 15% on a comparable basis. We're increasing our full year revenue outlook by $43 million at midpoint, with an updated range of $4.270 billion to $4.300 billion, an outlook for overall reported revenue growth of 9.6% to 10.3%. Our updated full year overall organic revenue growth outlook is for 8.8% to 9.5%, with organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.2%. These organic growth ranges represent approximately a 1% increase at midpoint to our previous guidance, supported by strong global execution in our CAG business. We're increasing our full year EPS outlook to $12.81 to $13.01 per share, up $0.33 per share at midpoint, reflecting 12% to 14% comparable EPS growth. We'll discuss our updated 2025 financial expectations later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of the third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 12% was driven by 12% CAG revenue gains, 7% growth in our Water business and 14% gains in LPD. Strong CAG results were supported by CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 10% organically, including average global net price improvement of 4% to 4.5%, and benefits from CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues increasing 71% organically, aided by global placements of InVue Dx. U.S. organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues grew 8% in Q3, supported by solid volume gains and 4% benefit from net price realization. U.S. same-store clinical visits declined 1.2% in the quarter, reflecting an IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits of approximately 950 basis points, highlighting outstanding performance by the IDEXX teams. Q3 benefited from aging pets with non-wellness visits declining only 30 basis points year-over-year while wellness visits declined 2.5%. Health services continued to expand in the quarter, including increased diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit for both well and non-wellness visits as customers expand the use of diagnostics in their care protocols. International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue grew 14% organically in Q3, including approximately a 1% benefit related to equivalent days. Revenue performance was driven by volume gains, including benefits of net new customers and same-store sales utilization. International regions have sustained strong growth on a days adjusted basis for the past 10 quarters, highlighting the significant global opportunity as we invest in global commercial capabilities and expansions. IDEXX innovation and commercial execution also delivered strong organic revenue gains across testing modalities globally in the third quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 16% on an organic basis in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international regions. Consumable revenue growth was supported by expansion of our premium instrument installed base and expanded testing utilization including benefits from recent product launches. InVue Dx utilization is tracking well to our reoccurring revenue estimates previously provided of $3,500 to $5,500 per analyzer, and we're excited for the upcoming launch of FNA starting with mast cell tumor detection. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q3 compared to prior year levels. Total premium placements reached 5,665 units, an increase of 37% year-over-year. The quality of placements remains excellent, reflected in 1,203 global new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 347 in North America. Globally, we placed 1,753 IDEXX InVue Dx instruments as we continue to meet customer demand for this highly innovative analyzer. Ongoing progress of placing instruments combined with high customer retention levels supported the 10% year-over-year growth in our premium instrument installed base in the quarter. IDEXX Global Reference Lab revenues increased 9% organically in Q3, up approximately 4% growth from the second quarter driven by solid volume growth across regions, including expanded same-store volume benefits and net new customer gains. IDEXX Cancer Dx continues to gain further traction in North America reaching nearly 5,000 customers through October. Global rapid assay revenues declined 5% organically in Q3. Rapid assay results continue to be impacted by customers shifting pancreatic lipase testing to our Catalyst instrument platform, which we estimate to be a 6% headwind in Q3 revenue growth. Veterinary software and diagnostic imaging organic revenues increased 11%, driven by recurring revenues which grew 10% during the quarter. Solid growth in veterinary software was supported by a strong double-digit growth of cloud-based PIMS installations and adoption of related reoccurring services. We also saw continued strong double-digit year-over-year growth of diagnostic imaging system placements in the quarter. Water revenues increased 7% organically in Q3 with strong growth in international regions and solid mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 14% organically in the quarter with double-digit gains across most regions. Turning to the P&L, strong revenue growth enabled 16% comparable operating profit gains. Gross profit increased 15% in the quarter as reported and 13% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.8%, up approximately 80 basis points on a comparable basis. These gains reflect benefits from strong reoccurring revenue growth and IDEXX VetLab consumables and Reference Lab volumes along with operational productivity and pricing benefits, which offset inflationary cost pressures. Reported gross margin gains were moderated by 10 basis points of foreign exchange impacts net of hedge positions. On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 12% year-over-year as we advance investments in our global commercial and innovation capabilities. Q3 earnings per share was $3.40 per share, including benefit of $14 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity. Income tax includes a $0.09 negative impact related to accelerating tax deductions for previously incurred research expenses allowed under the new U.S. tax legislation, which benefits cash taxes while increasing our effective tax rate in the period. Foreign exchange added $1.9 million to operating profit and $0.02 to EPS in Q3, net of hedge effects, reflecting a comparable EPS increase of 15%. Free cash flow was $371 million in Q3 and $964 million on a trailing 12-month basis with a net income to free cash flow conversion rate of 94%. For the full year, we're updating our outlook for free cash flow conversion to 95% to 100% of net income. This increase includes a 10% cash tax benefit primarily related to $105 million of acceleration of tax deductions for previously incurred research expenses allowed under recent U.S. tax legislation and a refined outlook for our full year capital spending of approximately $140 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We finished the period with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.5x net of cash. We continue to deploy capital towards share repurchases, allocating $242 million during the third quarter and contributing to $985 million on a year-to-date basis, supporting a 2.7% year-over-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding through Q3. Turning to our full year 2025. As noted, we're increasing our outlook for overall revenue to $4.270 billion to $4.300 billion. At midpoint, this reflects approximately $43 million of operational improvement, building on strong third quarter performance, including CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenue expansion and increased InVue Dx revenue expectations. Our updated revenue growth outlook is for 9.6% to 10.3% growth as reported, including a 0.8% full year growth benefit and 2% growth benefit in Q4 from foreign exchange at the rates outlined in our press release. As a sensitivity, a 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce revenue by approximately $4 million and EPS by $0.01 for the remainder of the year. The updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 8.8% to 9.5% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 7.5% to 8.2% for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, including a consistent 4% to 4.5% benefit from global net price realization. At midpoint, during Q4, we're assuming U.S. clinical visits continue to decline at levels moderately better than the year-to-date average. We are again increasing our expectations for our InVue Dx placements, which we now expect to be approximately 6,000 during 2025, with instrument revenues of over $65 million as we continue to see strong demand from this exciting new platform. In terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook to 31.6% to 31.8% in 2025, reflecting an increased expectation for 80 to 100 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement net of 180 basis point operating margin benefit related to the discrete litigation expense impacts and updated foreign exchange effects. As noted previously, IDEXX remains well positioned to navigate the ongoing changes in the trade landscape with a largely U.S.-based manufacturing footprint. We remain focused on continuous supply to customers while actively managing cost impacts, which will continue to play out into 2026. Our updated full year earnings per share outlook is $12.81 to $13.01 per share, an increase of $0.33 per share at midpoint. Our EPS outlook incorporates increased projections for operational improvement of $0.22 at midpoint compared to our prior guide. We've also incorporated lower effective tax rate benefits, including $0.09 of share-based compensation activity compared to the prior outlook, partially offset by other tax impacts including the noted acceleration of research expense deductions under the new U.S. tax legislation. Updated estimates for interest expense, average share count reduction and foreign exchange impacts have also been incorporated, with additional details available in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments.
Jay Mazelsky: Thank you, Andrew, and good morning. IDEXX delivered very strong financial performance in the third quarter while advancing our strategic priorities globally. Our proven model of high-touch commercial engagement, combined with differentiated testing and workflow innovations continue to drive adoption of IDEXX's world-class diagnostic and software solutions. These capabilities directly support our customers' mission to deliver the highest standards of care enabled through greater diagnostic frequency and utilization in everyday practice. Diagnostics remains the fastest-growing revenue stream within veterinary clinics, a durable trend reflecting the central role testing plays in determining patient health status and guiding treatment decisions. Our financial results in the quarter were underpinned by accelerating gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues across major regions. Growth in recurring revenues reflects multiple execution drivers, including double-digit growth of our premium installed base, instrument installed base, sustained strong new customer gains, solid net price realization and continued momentum in cloud-based software adoption. Importantly, these results were supported by continued momentum in our innovation playbook, highlighted by strong placements of InVue Dx, growing adoption of Cancer Dx, and benefits from the expanding Catalyst menu, including early uptake of Catalyst Cortisol. IDEXX solutions anchored by our integrated software-enabled multi-modality approach are well positioned to help clinics enhance efficiency, expand diagnostics reach, and deliver exceptional patient care. Building on the groundbreaking innovations we launched in 2025, and as highlighted at our August Investor Day, we will further expand our Cancer Dx franchise in 2026 with the addition of mast cell tumor and another high-impact cancer biomarker to the panel. We also plan to bring Cancer Dx panel to international markets starting in Q1 2026, extending its reach and accelerating our global leadership in veterinary cancer diagnostics. Our commercial organization again delivered outstanding performance in Q3. Across geographies, our teams drove very strong instrument placements with a high quality of placements supporting outstanding year-on-year growth of economic value placements, a key measure of future recurring revenue gains. Retention of our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue remained in the high 90s, reflecting the enduring loyalty and trust that veterinarians place in IDEXX. This loyalty is not simply the result of world-class products. It reflects the strength of our customer engagement and support model where IDEXX representatives serve as true partners in helping practices improve medical outcomes and business performance. In the U.S., growth was fueled by strong volume gains, including benefits from adoption of new innovations alongside sustained strong new and competitive Catalyst placements. Our teams are effectively engaging practices, whether start-ups outfitting their practice for the first time or established clinics seeking to upgrade and expand capabilities. Accelerated growth in the important diagnostics frequency metric as well as utilization per clinical visit is a critical driver of success, enhancing patient care while creating durable growth for both clinics and IDEXX. We are also benefiting from corporate account relationship extensions and expansions. These relationships represent significant multiyear growth opportunities as practices transition volume into IDEXX's ecosystem of diagnostic software and services. Importantly, these partnerships are increasingly structured to elevate care at the practice level, to greater diagnostics frequency, utilization, workflow optimization and expanded menu adoption. Internationally, we delivered double-digit installed base growth for the 11th consecutive quarter with the step-up in the growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth across major regions. Our commercial strategies are globally tailored to regional dynamics supported by strong Reference Laboratory networks and backed by an innovation approach that ensures high product market fit, such as with ProCyte One and SNAP Leishmania. Expanding diagnostic frequency in international regions continues to be a key growth lever, elevating the standard of care and expanding the sector opportunity. We remain committed to investing in our commercial footprint where the customer readiness and growth potential are strongest. We are on track with plans to expand in 3 international countries by the start of 2026, while also enhancing our U.S. commercial footprint. These are high-return investments, reducing the number of customers per account manager, supporting more frequent engagement, strengthening loyalty and driving adoption of IDEXX solutions. The commercial organization's ability to consistently deliver growth across varied geographies and macroeconomic conditions demonstrates the durability of our model. Practices continue to prioritize diagnostics and software because they are foundational to their mission, and IDEXX is their partner of choice. Turning to our innovation update, let me begin with Catalyst Cortisol, the newest addition to our Catalyst platform. Launched in North America in late July and at the end of the third quarter internationally, Catalyst Cortisol is already seeing strong momentum with over 1/4 of Catalyst customers in North America adopting test within the first 3 months of launch. This is among the fastest adoptions for Catalyst menu expansion, underscoring both the clinical need and the level of customer anticipation. Catalyst Cortisol enables veterinarians to rapidly measure cortisol levels at the point of care, supporting diagnosis and monitoring of adrenal conditions such as Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease. These conditions are often complex and require real-time insights to guide treatment decisions. With Catalyst Cortisol, veterinarians can deliver highly accurate results during the patient visit, avoiding delays, reducing callbacks and increasing confidence in treatment planning. The addition of Cortisol was the most frequently requested Catalyst menu expansion from customers, a clear signal of its importance to clinical practice. The rapid uptake we've seen validates the power of listening closely to our customers, and then delivering innovation that directly addresses their highest priority needs from both a testing accuracy standpoint in workflow friendly way. This is also a great example of our Technology for Life strategy. By continually expanding the Catalyst menu, we increase both the medical and economic value of the installed base. With nearly 77,000 Catalyst instruments and practices globally, each new menu expansion represents a lever for increased utilization, improved care and long-term recurring revenue. Alongside Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase, which has already achieved adoption across over 50% of the available installed base and Catalyst SmartQC, which is simplifying quality control workflows, Catalyst Cortisol is strengthening Catalyst position as the most versatile, value-creating chemistry, immunoassay and electrolyte platform in veterinary medicine. Moving to InVue Dx. By the end of Q3, we have placed over 4,400 InVue Dx analyzers globally year-to-date, exceeding our expectations in reinforcing the momentum that began with preorders last year. This represents one of the most successful product rollouts in IDEXX' history. This strong start gives us confidence to once again raise our full year outlook to approximately 6,000 placements. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with veterinarians consistently highlighting workflow transformation, diagnostic confidence and powerful clinical insight as the most meaningful benefits. The slide-free cytology workflow reduces technicians' time improves consistency and delivers results while the patients are still under practice. At the same time, AI models, now trained on more than 60 million cellular images, provide reliable, high-quality insights that elevate standards of care. Frequent software updates, as often as every other week, continuously expand these capabilities, enhancing accuracy and ensuring clinicians always benefit from the latest advancements. A great example of this is a recent update that reduced time to result of an ear cytology to approximately 8 minutes. Utilization for ear cytology or blood morphology has been robust and well-aligned with our expectations. Both of these broad-use categories have great use cases in everyday practice, serving as high-frequency diagnostics to support patient care across a wide range of conditions. Their adoption underscores the value of InVue Dx in addressing routine, repeatable testing needs to drive workflow efficiency and strengthen clinical confidence. Importantly, success in these initial categories provide a strong foundation for the platform, creating natural momentum as we expand the menu into additional high-value areas, such as oncology with the addition of fine needle aspirate, which remains on track for rollout later this year. Importantly, InVue Dx not only driving placements in consumables, but also strengthening customer loyalty and long-term contractual relationships. Many practices adopting InVue are expanding their broader IDEXX commitments with some extending agreements ahead of schedule to secure access to this transformative platform. Turning to Cancer Dx. Momentum remains strong with nearly 5,000 practices to date adopting these tests within just a few quarters of launch. Utilization is tracking well with expectations and we continue to be encouraged by competitive customer adoption, now over 17% of customers. This reflects growing awareness and underscores Cancer Dx' importance as a new standard in veterinary oncology. While the majority of samples are still being used to aid in the diagnosis of canine lymphoma, the number of practices incorporating the test into wellness protocols is nearing parity, enabling early detection and improved patient outcomes. The clinical need for oncology screening is clear. Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among dogs, and early detection is critical to improving outcomes. Cancer Dx provides veterinarians with a cost-effective, highly sensitive tool that integrates seamlessly into a standard wellness visit. Looking ahead, our Cancer Dx road map is ambitious as we expand internationally and have mast cell tumor detection in one additional cancer next year. With canine lymphoma and mast cell tumor detection, the Cancer Dx platform will address over 1/3 of all canine cancer cases. Mast cell tumors are top of mind with pet parents because they can often feel the lumps and bumps while petting or cuddling with their dog, and early detection can significantly improve the clinical outcome for an affected dog. The upcoming availability of FNA for lumps and bumps on InVue Dx will allow for cytology results during the patient visit, helping to provide clarity to a concern to pet parent. We have a couple of important highlights in our software business, specifically related to the broad-based adoption of our cloud-based products, reflecting the strength of IDEXX's vertical SaaS model purpose built for animal health. Veterinarians across all stages of their careers recognize the workflow efficiencies and ease of use that our solutions provide, enabling them to spend more time delivering care and less time on administrative tasks. Our cloud-native PIMS platforms delivered double-digit installed base growth again this quarter, surpassing a milestone, now with over 10,000 locations, and strong adoption among both independent practices and enterprise customers with multi-location groups. Customers are choosing IDEXX for our growing vertical SaaS platform where integrated modules create seamless workflows for clinicians and connectivity with diagnostics and increasingly for pet parents to Vello. Vello our client engagement platform continued to expand in Q3, with active clinics growing over 20% sequentially and over half of PIMS bookings in the quarter included a Vello subscription. Clinics using Vello report higher appointment adherence, increased diagnostics compliance and greater client satisfaction, all of which translated to higher visit volumes and revenue growth. The integration of Vello with our diagnostics and PIMS ecosystem further amplifies its value, making it an increasingly important part of IDEXX's long-term growth engine. As we conclude, I want to extend my deep gratitude to our 11,000 IDEXX employees worldwide. Your commitment to innovation, customer partnership and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver results like these. Q3 was another quarter where innovation and commercial execution came together to drive strong financial performance and advanced veterinary care. As diagnostics sit at the center of the veterinary system of care, IDEXX will remain at the forefront of advancing standards, unlocking practice productivity and driving sustainable growth. Now please open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.
Erin Wilson Wright: Great. I want to unpack a little bit the strength of consumables in the quarter and what's sustainable -- what's sustainable here. For instance, how much of the strength is actually InVue consumables, lipase or just the new contracting terms when you do place an InVue? For instance, you used to give us this metric back when you launched Catalyst Dx, that you used to say, with every Dx upgrade, it translated into a considerable amount of consumables uplift. I guess, do you have that metric when you're placing kind of InVue's, you're establishing and recontracting with new IDEXX 360 relationships? And presumably, this is an all InVue consumables contribution? I just want to unpack that.
Jay Mazelsky: Erin, yes, the growth in the VetLab consumables piece is very broad-based. So there's obviously the large installed base growth of 10%, and you can go back many quarters, and we continue to grow that very aggressively. And the quality of these placements is very high. We track economic value across the board; what we're seeing is high-quality placements competitive and greenfield is something we disclose both for chemistry and hematology, so you get a sense of that. Also the Technology for Life, the specialty tests, we've now had 3 within a period of a year. Those are -- those contribute. There's Pancreatic Lipase and SmartQC and now Cortisol. So these are tests that veterinarians prefer to do at the point of care, and that's clearly benefiting us. And I'd say -- by the way, it's, at an enterprise level, we're doing more testing in those areas. So this isn't a case of substituting from the reference lab to point of care. With respect to the InVue, I'd say that it's early stages. Obviously, it's all drop-through because it didn't exist before at the point of care and it's proceeding well to plan. And so that's an add, and as our installed base grows, we expect that, that will contribute greater amounts on a go-forward basis. But just to summarize, it's very broad-based growth across our point-of-care business.
Erin Wilson Wright: Okay. And then are we still on track with FNA and the launch? And what are you seeing from some of the pilot programs with FNA so far? And do you think there's this backlog of customers kind of waiting for FNA that should support another leg of growth here for InVue?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes, we are on track. What InVue customers tell us is that they -- there's very few customers that are just looking at one of the testing use cases, ear cytology or blood morphology or FNA testing for mast cell. They really are looking at as a broad portfolio tests that they would use. And obviously different mixes depending upon the practice and their preferences. So we expect that most of the customers, I can't say 100%, but the vast, vast majority of customers who purchase InVue for ear cytology and blood morphology will also use it for FNA testing. So we're very excited by that.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. [Operator Instructions]
Michael Ryskin: Can you guys hear me?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes.
Michael Ryskin: Yes. I want to follow up on some of your comments on end market business trending a little better. You guys continue to put up really impressive numbers. Can you hear me?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. Got you, Mike.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. Sorry. Just had some audio problems. You've put up really good numbers despite the end market weakness. I was just wondering if you could parse out a little bit, you talked a lot about InVue and the strength of that rollout there, whether you're seeing sort of the ability to leverage that for the rest of the business, the uplift you're seeing in consumables that will add consumables in the Reference Lab. Just sort of -- I don't know if I would call it a cross-selling opportunity, but just the ability to bring that into the vet clinic office, if that's leading to a stronger IDEXX premium and just ability to really drive the performance despite the continued softer macro? And I've got a follow-up.
Andrew Emerson: Thanks, Mike. This is Andrew. Maybe I'll just touch on your initial question on the sector, and then Jay may have a point of view on the portfolio side here. But ultimately, I think what we did see was the non-wellness visits were closer to flat in Q3. We did see some benefits from the pet population that was 5 years and older related to the clinical visits themselves. And then, as we've been highlighting, I think, with those adult dogs and cats transitioning to more seniors, we also see higher quality of the visits where we see expanded diagnostic frequency and utilization benefits with that as well. So that was one of the key drivers. What I would say is on the wellness side, we continue to see pressures from a macro perspective. We know there's still challenges out there just related to the consumers and the macro trends. Wellness visits did continue to decline, more about 2.5% overall within the quarter. So fairly consistent pressure on the more elective and wellness characteristics of that. We'll continue to monitor this sector. But to your point, I do think that as we think about the broader portfolio, there's really an opportunity to continue to play that out. We see Reference Labs tend to be a little bit more weighted to wellness visits, same with rapid assay. And so we do see a bit of a benefit in the IDEXX VetLab consumables, but I think there's an opportunity for us to continue to see benefits from the aging patients over time.
Jay Mazelsky: Yes, Mike, with respect to your question around InVue and its broader impact, we've always had, when we come out with a new instrument, it's a big deal. There are a direct economic benefits and there are indirect benefits. Obviously, the direct, you're placing an instrument that that's capital revenue and over time you build an installed base and the flywheel for recurring revenue. But most of these instruments get placed in some sort of marketing program, like IDEXX 360. And so the customer can satisfy volume commitments and is very often inspired to do more of their overall testing volume, including Reference Labs and rapid assay and our SaaS software solutions through us. And so those are the indirect benefits. And most of our -- about 2/3 of the InVue placements to date have come out of North America, 1/3 internationally. So we're excited. It does have some leverage impact, and we'll see more direct benefits, as I indicated earlier from just the recurring revenue stream of InVue.
Michael Ryskin: Okay. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up, you talked about investments a couple of times in the prepared remarks. Could you expand on that a little bit, between incremental R&D on future platforms and maybe to continue to work on Multi-Q Dx, I don't know how much you'll be able to talk about that, or the commercial sales force. Just wondering the strength that you've had in the top line this year, how you're flowing that through the model and just sort of what are your relative priorities for investment from that strength?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. I'll cover the investment piece and if Andrew would like to cover how we're thinking about the mix within the P&L., I'll hand it to him. From an investment standpoint, the way we think about it, there's commercial opportunity and sector development. We know that takes investments in reach and frequency of our sales organization. And so we're on track for the first of the year. They have 3 international and a modest increment in the U.S. We know these are good investments. These tend to be more of a short-return type of thing with a high confidence level because we have a playbook and a template in terms of how we think about it, and they fit well into our territories. And within 3 or 4 quarters, are trained and onboarded and very productive sales professionals. The ongoing R&D investments, these tend to be multiyear in horizon across the board. There's biomarker investment, obviously, that can be leveraged both reference labs and point of care, new instruments, InVue and Multi-Q Dx, those are ongoing and tend to be 4, 5 years. And then, obviously, the software piece is a critical part of our strategy, and we're investing heavily both in cloud-based PIM systems and Vello and the other software applications.
Andrew Emerson: Yes. Maybe just, Mike, in Q3 in particular, we highlighted 12% year-over-year growth in our operating expenses. So one of the things that we do always look at is how we're performing from an overall company perspective and making the right investments to continue to drive future growth. Again, if I take a step back and think about our longer-term growth algorithm, we constantly want to reinvest back into the business while still continuing to deliver solid operating margin gains over time here. And I think Q3 was a good example of our ability to do that. With higher top line growth, we were able to both contribute an operating margin gain benefit, but also invest heavily back into the business. And I think it's a really disciplined resource allocation approach to think about that mix across innovation and commercial and other support areas that Jay was highlighting that we want to make sure we get right.
Operator: The next question is from Jon Block with Stifel.
Jonathan Block: Maybe I'll just also start with InVue. The '25 placement guidance, I think I've got my math right, implies roughly 1,500 systems for 4Q '25. So still solid, and I know you raised the full year, but that would be down sequentially. You flipped from an order number to a placement number. So I guess the question here is, are you caught up with the orders when we think about where you are with InVue? And then just even any high-level thoughts on, I believe I've got it right, the initial 20,000 over 5 years. You're running well ahead in year 1 in totality. Any thoughts on the longer-term goals that you guys had put out? And then I'll ask a follow-up.
Andrew Emerson: Thanks, Jon, this is Andrew. So from an InVue perspective on the longer-term goal, we certainly are still focused on the 20,000 over 5 years. We haven't updated that. We're off to a strong start here and we're targeting 6,000 placements by the end of 2025, which is really our first year of launch ultimately. So we feel good about that 6,000 placement trajectory here, and that's well above our initial guide of 4,500 where we started the year. We've seen really strong demand for the platform itself. And I think we're going to continue to build on the impact that can have with FNA, starting with mast cell tumor detection as a great example of the extensibility of the platform overall. So nothing I would call out specifically. To your point, I think the math or the implied placement math that suggests 1,500 to 1,600 placements in Q4, and that's certainly still a very solid trajectory here, and we feel good about the trajectory that we're on for the platform overall.
Jonathan Block: Fair enough. And maybe I'll go to a different topic. I actually thought one of the most impressive metrics for the quarter was the international CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of almost 14%. I think it's the highest growth rate since coming out of or emerging out of COVID. And arguably, it doesn't really reflect much of InVue, no Cancer Dx. I think it's before the additional sales reps really take hold in the field. So it's always more limited visibility in the international markets. I know you've spoken to the increased double-digit in the installed base for 11 consecutive quarters. But there's got to be more than that even as traction. So any color you can provide there? And is this sort of the right run rate in the international markets, especially because you'll have those incoming tailwinds of innovation and sales reps going forward?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. So we're -- there's a couple of dimensions, I think, to think about from just an international opportunity standpoint. One is it's just more embryonic in terms of the use of diagnostics. And we have a tried and true approach from the standpoint of just developing the sector. And what we have found is it's very translatable to the international market. So obviously, the quantity of your sales professionals has a quality all its own. So being able to increase the sales organization. So it's important, and we've been doing that now for 4 or 5 years. But the other thing that I would just point out is the maturity of working within the system takes some time. So it's not just about the account manager or the VDC, it's about the full commercial ecosystem of the professional service and the field service representative and the inside sales then and all those working in a synchronized fashion. The other pieces that we've invested in internationally is the Reference Lab network and really building out a network that enables next-day performance. We've invested in software localizations like VetConnect PLUS, all of those pieces come together. In terms -- we just think there's an outstanding opportunity in the international geographies. We guided from a -- at Investor Day that the international opportunity is a couple of hundred basis points, I think, faster than the U.S. We feel good about that. We think that offers a pretty long-term horizon opportunity year-on-year that we can develop.
Andrew Emerson: Really great results in Q3. I would highlight that we did call out there's about 100 basis points of benefit related to equivalent days on the international business. So very significant results overall regardless, but we did see some modest days benefit in the quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Christopher Schott: Just a couple for me. Maybe just coming back on the aging pet commentary. It sounds like you're starting to see this supporting visits in the U.S. I guess is it fair to think about this point this now being a tailwind for the business as we look out to 2026 and beyond and start thinking about [ positive ] at least clinical visit growth or could this remain kind of bumpy in the near term? And just my follow-up was just on the international business and the discussion. Can you also elaborate on visit trends there? I guess we see a similar dynamic to the U.S. where the clinical visits are starting to pick up and wellness is still under some pressure, or is it more balanced in the international markets?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. I'll cover your second question first. We don't have as good visibility into clinical visits internationally just because we don't have the installed base of PIM systems, which allows us to access what is otherwise a very fragmented installed base of software. Our perspective, our market research suggests that it's largely stabilized from some of the choppiness we've seen over the last couple of years. So I think it's a stable environment, and we're clearly being able to execute against an environment that we think over time will improve. From the standpoint of the aging pets, the non-wellness visit essentially flat, we did see that adult dogs coming for more non-wellness visits. Some of that is likely pandemic dogs, designer breeds that are more heavily medicalized, larger breeds, larger dogs that get sicker earlier in their life spans, in terms of how that sustains quarter-to-quarter remains to be same. This is just a data point. I think what we could say with a good degree of confidence is that these pets, as they age from the pandemic and the large step-up that we've seen, will come into the practice more for sick care and that, from a clinical visit trend standpoint, it will be very positive.
Operator: The next question is from Daniel Clark with Leerink Partners.
Daniel Christopher Clark: I also wanted to ask on international, maybe in a little bit of a different way. On a days adjusted basis, CAG recurring grew at least 13% in the quarter. As you mentioned on the call, your kind of growth potential is 13% to 16%. So like what gets us up to the 15%, 16% range? Is it just continued sales rollout? Or what else should we be thinking about here?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. It's really all the pieces that I mentioned. We're going to continue to invest in sales force expansions over time. That's really a function of time and distance and maturity of the sales organization. We're very disciplined about that. We want to make sure the market is ready. There's a product market fit dimension that we evaluate expansions and growth. For example, ProCyte One, that was -- the hematology analyzer, really designed at the inception for our international hematology first markets in terms of cost and footprint. It's super important just to Reference Lab network. So we continue to build out our Reference Labs on a global basis, both from a European geography, but also within various markets in Asia Pacific, we know that, that's super important, and then making sure that the customer support or customer experience proceeds is ahead of the investment in commercial. We want to make sure that customers who may not know IDEXX and the first exposure to IDEXX, they get not just solutions that perform at a very high level, but the support organization is there in-country, supporting them when they have all challenges. We think all those things combined give us a lot of confidence that the 13% to 16% growth rate is achievable.
Daniel Christopher Clark: Just had a quick follow-up on visits. Last third quarter, you talked about 1% to 1.5% growth benefit to visits from launch of a different company's pain medicine. Was there any impact on headline visit numbers in the quarter as you've lapped that launch?
Andrew Emerson: Yes, Dan, I think just in terms of the metric that you're quoting, I think that was from the prior year. We had highlighted that we have seen some effect on clinical visits and the inverse impact on diagnostic frequency. Really what we're just trying to call out is the change in the metrics themselves and not necessarily an impact on our IDEXX business directly. And so there's nothing I'd call out or highlight as part of the change or impact that we saw here in Q3 related to that at this point. And again, I think we're in at least a clean view from both the sector metrics and what we've highlighted for the interim performance that we've had in IDEXX.
Operator: The next question is from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.
Brandon Vazquez: Congrats on a nice quarter. I'll just ask 1 here because we're coming up on time. But you highlighted the ability to get into some competitive accounts with Cancer Dx. Just curious, given on the Reference Lab side, given there's a lot of contracts there, what's your ability to maybe use that as a foot in the door and start taking share, even more share, within that market? So just talk a little bit about what that commercial process can look like and how long that might take given you're kind of opening new doors there?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. Brandon, our reference portfolio is very broad and differentiated. Clearly, that's a point that Cancer Dx test is a point of differentiation and having approximately 17% of test submissions coming from competitive Reference Lab customers, I think, is something that is gratifying both from these pets getting a better standard of care. And also that gives us an opportunity to put our best foot forward and reintroduce, in some cases, the IDEXX and the IDEXX Reference Lab to these customers. So it's an important piece, but I think it's just a piece.
Operator: The next question is from Andrea Alfonso with UBS.
Andrea Zayco Narvaez Alfonso: I just have a question on Cancer Dx. You noted the 5,000 ordering practice. I guess just with respect to adoption in terms of the screening panel, are you able to frame at all sort of how that sort of thinking in terms of just general cutoff points as far as age and frequency, where there's sort of agreeing on a sweet spot? And obviously, wellness visits, you continue to lag, so how is the company engaging that as far as initiating those talking points?
Jay Mazelsky: Sure. There's 2 separate use cases for Cancer Dx. One is an aid in diagnosis. So these are typically dogs that come in, they have clinical symptoms consistent with lymphoma, and veterinarians are using this as a test. At this point, they represent the majority, but just bare majority of tests. And then the screening test that is more wellness screening, and that we think it makes sense for dogs that are 7 years or older, as well as breeds that may have a higher incidence of cancer. So we believe that over time, what we're going to see is we're going to see the test used it will flip. It will be more as a screening test, but also aid in diagnosis for sick patients, but that will be the minority of cases. The other thing that I would point out is, as the panel expands, so if you think about lymphoma, plus mast cell tumor detection, that represents over 1/3 of cancer cases in dogs. It becomes a much more compelling value proposition as part of a wellness screening. And we've also indicated that there will be a third cancer screen in 2026. So at that point, we think this -- it's sufficient in terms of menu comprehensiveness to really be seen by customers as an attractive screening test.
Operator: The next question is from Keith Devas with Jefferies.
Keith Devas: Maybe just higher level, just thinking about the thoughts on the pace of innovation you guys have done a lot, obviously, in the last year. There's more coming next year. How do you guys know you're not doing too much too soon or too much that the market can or can't absorb it, macro environment is only slightly improving maybe from your standpoint? And maybe the second follow-up is, do you think the planned reinvestment plans that you have from this year and into next year is enough? And how you might course correct if things are a little bit better than anticipated?
Jay Mazelsky: Yes. We're -- we think the innovation agenda portfolio is aggressive, but aggressive from an intentional standpoint, that it represents a set of portfolio solutions, whether it's assays or new instruments or software that our customers are hungry for. Clearly, our commercial organization has a very large footprint, and they're subject matter experts and they're able to digest these testing solutions and bring them to customers in ways that allow testing growth. So the opportunities abound. Ours is a sector development business model, and innovation is a key driver behind being able to develop the sector. And so with that, we'll now conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for your participation and engagement this morning. It's once again my pleasure to share IDEXX executed against our organic growth strategy while delivering strong financial results in the third quarter. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

- Q3 2025 U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth — Current: Q3 2025 "reflecting over 8% gains in the U.S." (also stated as U.S. organic grew 8%).
  - 2025-Q2 U.S. Organic CAG Diagnostic Recurring Revenues Growth "6%": Q2 U.S. growth was 6%. Difference/trend: Q3 U.S. growth (8%) is higher than Q2 (6%) — sequential improvement and above prior-year quarters.

- Q3 2025 international CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth — Current: Q3 2025 "double-digit growth in international regions" / "International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue grew 14% organically in Q3".
  - 2024-Q3 CAG Diagnostic Recurring Revenue Growth "7%": international/overall prior-year Q3 was ~7%. Difference: current 14% is materially higher — strong international acceleration.

- Q3 2025 CAG instrument revenue organic growth — Current: Q3 2025 "71% organic growth of CAG instrument revenues".
  - 2024-Q1 CAG Instrument Revenue Growth "3%": 2024-Q1 instrument growth was 3%. Difference: current 71% vs prior small single-digit growth is an extreme jump — large one-quarter instrument revenue surge relative to past periods.

- Q3 2025 operating margin expansion — Current: Q3 2025 "comparable operating margin gains of 120 basis points".
  - 2024-Q3 Operating Margins in Q3 "Up 110 basis points year-on-year (31.2%)": Q3 2024 saw ~110 bps improvement. Comparison: current 120 bps is slightly better than Q3 2024's improvement — similar magnitude, modestly stronger margin expansion year-over-year.

- Q3 2025 EPS and growth — Current: Q3 2025 "earnings per share of $3.40 ... EPS growth of 15% on a comparable basis".
  - 2024-Q3 EPS in Q3 "$2.80 per share" (EPS up 11% as reported / 12% comparable): prior Q3 EPS $2.80. Comparison: current EPS $3.40 is higher (3.40 vs 2.80) and comparable EPS growth 15% exceeds the prior-year comparable increase (12%) — clear bottom-line improvement.

- Q3 2025 gross margin and expansion — Current: Q3 2025 "Gross margins were 61.8%, up approximately 80 basis points on a comparable basis."
  - 2024-Q3 Operating Margins "31.2%, up 110 basis points": different margin level (gross vs operating), but operating margin improvement in 2024-Q3 was +110 bps. Comparison: gross margin up ~80 bps in Q3 2025 indicates margin expansion at the gross level; operating margin comparable improvement is +120 bps this quarter — both point to improved profitability versus prior periods.

- Q3 2025 free cash flow and conversion — Current: Q3 2025 "Free cash flow was $371 million in Q3 and $964 million TTM with net income to free cash flow conversion rate of 94%."
  - 2024-Q3 Free Cash Flow in Q3 "$192 million": Q3 2024 FCF was $192M. Comparison: Q3 2025 FCF $371M is substantially higher (nearly double), and TTM conversion 94% is a strong conversion rate relative to historical commentary — major improvement in cash generation.

- Q3 2025 share repurchases and share count impact — Current: Q3 2025 "allocating $242 million during the third quarter ... $985 million YTD, supporting a 2.7% Y/Y reduction in diluted shares outstanding through Q3."
  - (No exact prior-quarter repurchase number provided in the most-similar list for direct numeric comparison.) Comparison: the stated $985M YTD and 2.7% share count reduction are consistent with active buybacks that support EPS improvement versus prior-year periods.

Summary of direction vs most recent similar facts: for key bottom-line items (EPS, operating margin expansion, gross margin improvement, free cash flow), Q3 2025 is higher/better than the most recent comparable prior quarters (notably vs 2024‑Q3 and 2025‑Q2). Instrument revenues (71%) and FCF ($371M vs $192M) show the largest positive deltas.

2. Supported outcomes
- Management commentary: updated full-year EPS outlook and comparable EPS growth guidance (fact 14) — confirmation: Q3 comparable EPS growth of 15% and YTD EPS progression support stronger-than-guided near-term EPS performance and validate management's upward EPS trajectory.
- Management commentary: operating margin and gross margin expansion (facts 9 and 35) — confirmation: reported comparable operating margin gains of 120 basis points and gross margin up ~80 basis points in Q3 confirm management's claim of margin improvement versus prior-year periods (2024-Q3 showed ~110 bps operating improvement).
- Management commentary: free cash flow conversion outlook and tax-driven uplift (facts 39 and 40) — confirmation: Q3 FCF $371M, TTM $964M and conversion rate 94% plus the stated $105M acceleration of R&D tax deductions (10% cash tax benefit) support management's updated full-year FCF conversion guidance and explanation for improved cash conversion.
- Management commentary: share repurchases supporting EPS (fact 43) — confirmation: $242M repurchased in Q3 and $985M YTD with a 2.7% reduction in diluted shares materially support bottom-line (EPS) improvement versus prior periods.

Overall conclusion (bottom-line focus): Q3 2025 shows clear bottom-line improvement versus the most similar recent quarters — higher EPS ($3.40 vs $2.80 prior-year Q3), stronger comparable EPS growth (15% vs ~12% prior-year Q3), modestly better operating margin expansion (120 bps vs ~110 bps), and materially higher free cash flow ($371M vs $192M). Management's comparisons and guidance (EPS, margins, free cash flow conversion, buybacks) are supported by the reported Q3 numbers.

Historical‑Calls note:
1) Validate past guidances (met / beat / missed in 2025‑Q3)
- Full‑year 2025 revenue outlook (2025‑Q2 guidance): Beat.
  - Prior guidance (2025‑Q2): $4,205M to $4,280M. Current (Q3 update): $4,270M to $4,300M — company raised the range and the new upper bound ($4,300M) exceeds the prior upper bound ($4,280M) by $20M.
- Full‑year 2025 EPS outlook (2024‑Q4 guidance): Beat.
  - Prior guidance (2024‑Q4): $11.74 to $12.24. Current (Q3 update): $12.81 to $13.01 — the updated range is materially above the prior range.
- InVue Dx instrument revenue / placements (multiple prior guidances): Mixed — beaten vs earlier targets, but one earlier placement target not yet achieved as of Q3 YTD.
  - Prior (2024‑Q4 / 2025‑Q1): ~4,500 placements and ~$50M instrument revenue for 2025. As of end of Q3 YTD placements were >4,400 (so slightly below the 4,500 full‑year target as of Q3), but Q3 management updated full‑year expectation to ~6,000 placements with instrument revenues of over $65M — i.e., the company raised its expectations well above the earlier 4,500 / $50M targets (so revenue/placement outlooks were increased).
  - Verdicts: Missed to date relative to the 4,500 placements target (4,400 YTD through Q3), but overall guidance trajectory has been raised (now expecting ~6,000 placements and >$65M instrument revenue), which exceeds the earlier targets.
- InVue Dx placements (2025‑Q2 guidance of 5,500 placements): Beat.
  - Prior guidance (2025‑Q2): 5,500 placements. Current Q3 update: approximately 6,000 placements expected for 2025.
- Global net price realization assumed for 2025 (2024‑Q4 guidance): Met.
  - Prior assumption: 4.0% to 4.5% global net price realization. Realized/reported in Q3: average global net price improvement of 4.0% to 4.5%.
- Free cash flow conversion (earlier guidance 90%–95%): Beat.
  - Prior guidance/expectation: 90% to 95% of net income. Current (Q3 update): updated outlook to 95%–100% of net income.
- Reported operating margin outlook (prior 31.3%–31.6% / 31.0%–31.5% ranges): Beat.
  - Prior guidance (2025‑Q2): 31.3% to 31.6% (and earlier 31.0%–31.5%). Current (Q3 update): 31.6% to 31.8% — the updated range is at or above prior upper bounds.

(If a prior forward‑looking item could not be directly compared to a Q3 realized or updated number in the facts you provided, it was omitted.)

2) Compare results discussed (concrete numbers)
- Total reported revenue growth: Q3 2025 was +13% as reported vs +11% reported in 2025‑Q2 (prior quarter) — an acceleration of ~200 bps.
- Organic revenue growth: Q3 2025 was +12% organically vs +5% organic in 2025‑Q1 (earlier this year) and vs ~6% in 2024‑Q3 — substantial improvement year over year and versus earlier 2025 quarter.
- CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth: Q3 2025 was "over 10% organic" vs ~7% in 2024‑Q3 — a clear step up.
- U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth: Q3 2025 was +8% (supported by +4% net price) vs +6% in 2025‑Q2 — improvement.
- International CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth: Q3 2025 was double‑digit / +14% internationally (including ~1% equivalent days benefit) vs ~11% in 2025‑Q2 — stronger international momentum.
- CAG instrument revenues (organic): Q3 2025 +71% organic growth (strong instrument demand) vs historical single‑digit instrument growth (e.g., 3% in 2024‑Q1) — large YoY step driven by new placements.
- Premium instrument placements: Q3 2025 reached 5,665 units (up 37% YoY) vs 6,070 units in 2025‑Q2 (Q2 was a record quarter) — Q3 is slightly below Q2’s record but still strong YoY growth.
- Premium instrument installed base growth: Q3 2025 +10% YoY, consistent with prior quarter trends (previously reported ~9%–10%).
- IDEXX VetLab consumables: Q3 2025 +16% organic vs +14% in 2025‑Q2 — stronger consumables growth.
- Global rapid assay revenues: Q3 2025 declined 5% organically vs +6% growth reported in 2024‑Q3 — a reversal from prior-year growth to current decline.
- Gross margin and operating margin expansion: Q3 2025 gross margin 61.8% (+80 bps comparable) and comparable operating margin gains of ~120 bps; prior comparable operating margin improvement was ~110 bps in 2024‑Q3 — modestly stronger margin expansion in Q3 2025.
- EPS: Q3 2025 EPS $3.40, representing +15% comparable EPS growth vs prior Q3 EPS of $2.80 (2024‑Q3) which was +11% as reported / +12% comparable — EPS improved both in absolute dollars and growth rate.

Peers note:
English

- Q3 2025 reported revenue growth (Revenue increased 13% as reported)
  - IDXX emphasizes strong double‑digit reported growth (+13%). This outpaces the comparable AKAM Q3 example, which grew to $1.055B (+5% y/y), showing IDXX is highlighting a materially stronger top‑line increase versus at least some peers (AKAM 2025‑Q3: "$1.055 billion", +5%).  

- Q3 2025 organic revenue growth ("12% organically")
  - IDXX frames performance as high organic growth (12%). Peers span a wide range — some medtech names reported low single digits (BDX Q1 2025 organic 3.9%), while other diagnostics peers reported much higher (DXCM Q3 2025 organic ~20%), so IDXX positions itself in the upper‑mid of that peer distribution (BDX 2025‑Q1: "3.9%"; DXCM 2025‑Q3: "20%").

- Q3 2025 CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth ("over 10% organic growth")
  - IDXX emphasizes >10% recurring growth in CAG Diagnostics; comparable livestock/diagnostics peers show single‑ and double‑digit outcomes (ZTS livestock ~10% in Q3 2025). IDXX therefore signals stronger recurring diagnostics momentum versus peers that report mid‑single or low‑double digit growth (ZTS 2025‑Q3: "10%").

- Q3 2025 U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth ("reflecting over 8% gains in the U.S.")
  - IDXX points to U.S. recurring growth ~8% whereas some peers report either weaker U.S. trends (BDX lower organic) or disparate results. The available peer examples do not show a direct U.S‑recurring analogue but indicate IDXX is stressing relative strength in core domestic recurring revenue.

- Q3 2025 international CAG recurring organic growth ("double‑digit growth in international regions" / 14% organically including ~1% days benefit)
  - IDXX highlights robust international double‑digit growth (14% incl. days). This compares favorably to peers describing international expansion but with mixed magnitudes (DXCM/others discussing expansion); IDXX is emphasizing a clear international lead (IDXX vs DXCM international expansion references).

- Q3 2025 CAG instrument revenue organic growth ("71% organic growth of CAG instrument revenues")
  - IDXX calls out a very large (71%) instrument revenue surge driven by placements. Comparable historical calls from device manufacturers show strong adoption but not often this magnitude; e.g., ISRG reported installed‑system metrics (Da Vinci systems 509) rather than explosive instrument revenue growth, so IDXX is uniquely highlighting an outsized instrument‑revenue step‑up (ISRG 2025‑Q1: "509 systems").

- Q3 2025 premium instrument placements (5,665 units, +37% y/y)
  - IDXX explicitly attributes instrument placements to growth (5,665, +37%). Comparable firms reference installed‑base milestones (AAPL "all‑time high") or double‑digit adoption (ISRG ION 30%), but IDXX provides absolute unit counts and a very large placement growth rate relative to those peers (AAPL 2024‑Q4: "Reached an all‑time high"; ISRG 2025‑Q3: "30%").

- Q3 2025 operating margin expansion ("comparable operating margin gains of 120 basis points")
  - IDXX reports a 120 bps comparable operating margin improvement. Peers exhibit a range of margin changes (COO Q1 2025 referenced a 6.5% operating margin figure, other peers show smaller bps moves). IDXX is emphasizing sustainable margin expansion alongside growth (COO 2025‑Q1: "25.1% operating margin").

- Q3 2025 gross margin and expansion (61.8%, +~80 bps)
  - IDXX reports 61.8% gross margin, up ~80 bps. Comparable calls show diverse gross margins (LULU 58.3% up 60 bps; ALGN 69.7% in another sector), so IDXX frames a solid mid‑high gross margin with modest expansion relative to peers (LULU 2025‑Q1: "58.3%", ALGN 2024‑Q3: "69.7%").

- Q3 2025 EPS and growth ($3.40, +15% comparable)
  - IDXX reports $3.40 EPS (+15%). Peers cited show lower absolute EPS examples (CAH $2.35 Q3 2025) or different growth rates, so IDXX is stressing both strong absolute EPS and healthy double‑digit comparable EPS growth versus a mixed peer set (CAH 2025‑Q3: "$2.35").

- Q3 2025 free cash flow and TTM conversion ($371M Q3; $964M TTM; 94% net‑income→FCF)
  - IDXX emphasizes very high conversion (94% TTM). Peers have similar guidance ranges (GNRC and others guiding 90–100% conversion; ROK referenced 100%), so IDXX is consistent with the stronger end of peer expectations and uses TTM evidence to support the claim (GNRC 2025‑Q2: "90% to 100%"; ROK 2025‑Q1: "100%").

- 2025 full‑year free cash flow conversion outlook (95% to 100% of net income)
  - IDXX updates a tight, high conversion outlook (95–100%). That aligns with recent peer guidance ranges cited (GNRC 90–100%, ROK 100%), but IDXX is slightly more bullish at the top of that peer range (GNRC 2025‑Q2: "90% to 100%").

- 2025 full‑year revenue outlook ($4.270B–$4.300B; reported growth 9.6–10.3%)
  - IDXX gives a narrow, high‑single to low‑double digit growth revenue guide. Comparable firms’ full‑year guidance ranges vary (AKAM $4.135B–$4.205B; others larger or lower), so IDXX is positioning itself with a concise, confident revenue range in line with strong growth peers (AKAM 2025‑Q2: "$4.135B to $4.205B").

- 2025 full‑year organic revenue growth outlook (8.8% to 9.5%)
  - IDXX guides organic growth near 9%. Peers’ organic guidance varies from low single digits to double digits (FISV 10–12% cited). IDXX’s outlook sits below the highest peer ranges (DXCM 10–12 guidance examples) but above many large‑cap medtech peers (BDX mid‑single digits) (FISV 2025‑Q1: "10% to 12%"; BDX 2025‑Q1: "3.9%").

- 2025 organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth outlook (7.5% to 8.2%)
  - IDXX expects mid‑to‑high single‑digit recurring growth for CAG. That is more conservative than IDXX’s own Q3 run‑rate (>10%) and sits below some aggressive peer recurring trajectories; peers like ZTS reported ~10% in livestock but not directly comparable. IDXX is signaling a normalization from the quarter to a still solid full‑year recurring pace (ZTS 2025‑Q3: "10%").

- 2025 CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue price realization outlook (4% to 4.5% benefit)
  - IDXX explicitly attributes a consistent 4–4.5% price realization benefit to recurring diagnostics. Peers often cite price/volume mix but with less explicit consistent percent guidance; IDXX is unusually explicit about a multi‑percent, repeatable price contribution.

- 2025 InVue Dx placements and instrument revenue outlook (~6,000 placements; >$65M instrument revenues)
  - IDXX provides discrete placement and instrument revenue guidance for a sub‑product (InVue Dx). Peers rarely give both unit placement and dollar instrument revenue at this granularity in the snippets; IDXX is more granular (no direct comparable in the peer list).

- 2025 reported operating margin outlook (31.6% to 31.8%; 80–100 bps comparable improvement)
  - IDXX is raising and tightening operating margin guidance and quantifying expected comparable improvement (80–100 bps). Peers cite a range of operating margin targets (NOW 30.5% for 2025 or others), so IDXX is aligning with peers that are targeting mid‑30s margins but calls out an explicit bps improvement target (NOW 2025‑Q1: "30.5%").

- Q3 2025 total organic revenue growth by segment (12% CAG, 7% Water, 14% LPD)
  - IDXX provides segment‑level organic growth showing broad‑based strength (particularly LPD at 14%). Comparable firm examples often report segment growth but with different magnitudes; ZTS’s livestock examples (~10%) are similar in direction but lower in magnitude to IDEXX’s LPD (ZTS 2025‑Q3: "10%").

- Q3 2025 IDEXX VetLab consumable revenue organic growth (+16%)
  - IDXX highlights strong consumable attachment/consumable growth (+16%). Peers in consumables/diagnostics show mixed results (some mid‑single digits); IDXX is emphasizing higher consumable growth supporting recurring revenue (no direct peer consumable number in the list to contradict).

- Q3 2025 Global Reference Lab organic revenue growth (+9%, +4% sequential acceleration)
  - IDXX calls out both y/y growth and sequential acceleration. Comparable peer calls reference growth acceleration in service segments but with different magnitudes; IDXX is highlighting improving momentum (ROK/others mention lifecycle/service strength but not identical metrics).

- Q3 2025 global rapid assay organic revenue decline (-5%)
  - IDXX discloses a decline (-5%) and attributes part of that to instrument migration of pancreatic lipase testing (6% headwind). Peers mention similar product‑shift headwinds (NKE referenced a mid‑single‑digit headwind from portfolio shifts), showing IDXX’s candid disclosure of the technical headwind aligns with how some peers describe product substitution impacts (NKE 2025‑Q1: "mid‑single digit headwind").

- Rapid assay headwind from pancreatic lipase shift (estimated 6% Q3 revenue headwind)
  - IDXX quantifies the headwind (6%). A comparable peer noted a mid‑single digit headwind from portfolio shifts, so IDXX’s explicit percentage is consistent with industry practice of quantifying substitution effects (NKE 2025‑Q1: "mid‑single digit headwind").

- Q3 2025 U.S. same‑store clinical visits (-1.2%) and visit mix (non‑wellness -0.3 pp vs wellness -2.5%)
  - IDXX links modest visit declines to macro pressures (wellness down 2.5%). This contrasts with some healthcare peer comments that reported visits above year‑ago (UNH Q1 2025 had visits "running far above" prior year), so IDXX is calling out a weaker demand environment in veterinary visits relative to certain human healthcare peers (UNH 2025‑Q1: "Total visits... far above the year‑ago period").

- IDEXX U.S. CAG recurring revenue growth premium to visits (~950 bps)
  - IDXX highlights that revenue growth materially outpaced visits (~9.5% points), emphasizing attach, pricing, and test mix. Peers seldom report a direct "premium to visits" metric in the snippets, so IDXX is using a differentiated operational KPI to argue revenue resilience.

- Catalyst installed base (~77,000 instruments and practices globally)
  - IDXX reports a large installed base (nearly 77k). Peer device examples report much smaller absolute installed bases (ISRG Da Vinci ~509 systems) or 'all‑time high' language (AAPL), so IDXX is emphasizing scale of its installed base in a way that underscores recurring consumable revenue potential (ISRG 2025‑Q1: "509 systems"; AAPL 2024‑Q4: "Reached an all‑time high").

- Cloud‑native PIMS installed base (>10,000 locations, double‑digit installed base growth)
  - IDXX highlights >10k PIMS locations and double‑digit growth; peers discuss installed base growth broadly (AAPL all‑time high) or mid‑single digit installed base growth (OTIS), so IDXX emphasizes a software‑linked growth engine with stronger adoption than some peers (AAPL 2024‑Q4: "Reached an all‑time high"; OTIS 2024‑Q4: "Mid‑single‑digits").

- Vello growth and attachment to PIMS (active clinics +20% sequential; >50% PIMS bookings included Vello)
  - IDXX stresses rapid sequential expansion and a >50% attach rate. Peer references show double‑digit SaaS/add‑on adoption in other contexts but fewer examples with this attach‑rate granularity, so IDXX is more explicit about software attach dynamics (BDX 2025‑Q2: "Strong double‑digit growth" in a product line).

- Cancer Dx expansion roadmap (2026 additions and international rollout Q1 2026) and coverage projection ("will address over 1/3 of all canine cancer cases")
  - IDXX gives concrete product roadmap timing and a coverage projection (over 1/3). Peers reference international expansion plans or product rollouts but without the same biomarker coverage quantification; IDXX is more specific on clinical coverage and timing (DXCM 2025‑Q1: "Expecting expansions in 2025"; HOOD 2024‑Q4: "Plans for international expansion").

Summary conclusion
- IDXX consistently emphasizes a combination of high organic and reported growth, strong instrument placement‑driven instrument revenue, durable recurring revenue (supported by explicit net‑price realization), high cash conversion, and detailed product/market expansion roadmaps. Compared with the heterogeneous peer set, IDXX tends to (a) provide more granular unit and percentage quantification for instrument placements and headwinds, (b) call out explicit price realization percentages, and (c) position itself at the upper end of growth and cash‑conversion ranges cited by peers (peer evidence: AKAM, BDX, DXCM, GNRC, ROK, NKE entries as noted above).

Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)

- Q3 2025 報告營收成長（Revenue increased 13% as reported）
  - IDXX 強調兩位數的報告營收成長（+13%）。這超過可比公司 AKAM 的範例（Q3 營收 $1.055B，+5%），顯示 IDXX 突顯出比部分同業更強的營收表現（AKAM 2025‑Q3: "$1.055 billion", +5%）。

- Q3 2025 有機營收成長（"12% organically"）
  - IDXX 報稱高水準的有機成長（12%）。同業範例分歧較大 — 有些醫材公司報低個位數（BDX 2025‑Q1 有機 3.9%），而其他診斷同行則更高（DXCM 2025‑Q3 有機約 20%），IDXX 屬於該分布的上中段（BDX 2025‑Q1: "3.9%"; DXCM 2025‑Q3: "20%"）。

- Q3 2025 CAG 診斷經常性有機營收成長（"over 10% organic growth"）
  - IDXX 強調 CAG 診斷經常性收入 >10%。可比較的畜牧/診斷同業呈現單位數或低雙位數（ZTS 畜牧 Q3 約 10%），因此 IDXX 表示其經常性診斷動能優於報告為中低位數的同業（ZTS 2025‑Q3: "10%"）。

- Q3 2025 美國 CAG 診斷經常性成長（"reflecting over 8% gains in the U.S."）
  - IDXX 指出美國經常性成長約 8%。雖然同業範例中沒有直接對應美國經常性數據，但 IDXX 強調在核心國內市場的相對強度。

- Q3 2025 國際 CAG 診斷經常性成長（"double‑digit growth" / 14% 包含約 1% 日數效應）
  - IDXX 強調國際雙位數成長（14% 含天數效應）。這相較於同業提到的國際擴張呈現更明顯的成長領先，IDXX 強調其國際成長領先同業。

- Q3 2025 CAG 儀器營收有機成長（"71% organic growth"）
  - IDXX 報出極高的儀器營收成長（71%），由放置驅動。裝置製造商的歷史財報常顯示強採用，但少有這種量級的儀器營收躍升；例如 ISRG 報出系統數（509），但未展現此等儀器營收增幅 (ISRG 2025‑Q1: "509 systems")。

- Q3 2025 高階儀器放置數（5,665 台，年增 37%）
  - IDXX 明確以放置數推動成長（5,665 台，+37%）。同業常以安裝基數或採用率表述（AAPL「all‑time high」；ISRG ION 30%），但 IDXX 提供絕對單位與高成長率，凸顯差異（AAPL 2024‑Q4: "Reached an all‑time high"; ISRG 2025‑Q3: "30%"）。

- Q3 2025 營運利潤率擴張（"comparable operating margin gains of 120 basis points"）
  - IDXX 報出可比營運利潤率改善 120 bps。可比公司呈現不同幅度的利潤變動（COO 2025‑Q1 報 25.1% 營運利潤），IDXX 強調在成長同時實現利潤擴張（COO 2025‑Q1: "25.1% operating margin"）。

- Q3 2025 毛利率與擴張（61.8%，+約 80 bps）
  - IDXX 報 61.8% 毛利，較去年 +80 bps。可比公司毛利率差異較大（LULU 58.3% +60 bps；ALGN 69.7%），IDXX 表示中高檔毛利並有小幅改善（LULU 2025‑Q1: "58.3%"; ALGN 2024‑Q3: "69.7%"）。

- Q3 2025 每股盈餘與成長（$3.40，+15% 可比）
  - IDXX 報 $3.40 EPS（+15%）。同業示例中絕對 EPS 值較低（CAH $2.35），IDXX 強調既有較高絕對 EPS 亦有雙位數可比成長（CAH 2025‑Q3: "$2.35"）。

- Q3 2025 自由現金流與 TTM 轉換（Q3 $371M；TTM $964M；淨利轉自由現金流 94%）
  - IDXX 強調非常高的轉換率（94% TTM）。同業指引出現相似範圍（GNRC 90–100%；ROK 100%），IDXX 屬於同業中偏高端的轉換表現（GNRC 2025‑Q2: "90% to 100%"; ROK 2025‑Q1: "100%"）。

- 2025 全年自由現金流轉換展望（95%–100% 淨利）
  - IDXX 更新為 95–100%，與部分同業 90–100% 範圍相近，但 IDXX 更靠近該範圍上端（GNRC 2025‑Q2: "90% to 100%"）。

- 2025 全年營收展望（$4.270B–$4.300B；報告成長 9.6–10.3%）
  - IDXX 給予緊湊且偏高的年度營收區間。可比公司指引範圍差異大（AKAM $4.135B–$4.205B 等），IDXX 表示其成長目標屬於堅實且集中範圍（AKAM 2025‑Q2: "$4.135B to $4.205B"）。

- 2025 全年有機營收成長展望（8.8%–9.5%）
  - IDXX 指引接近 9%。同業有機指引涵蓋從低個位到雙位數（FISV 10–12%），IDXX 位於高於許多大廠但低於部分高增長同業的位置（FISV 2025‑Q1: "10% to 12%"; BDX 2025‑Q1: "3.9%"）。

- 2025 CAG 診斷經常性有機成長展望（7.5%–8.2%）
  - IDXX 對全年經常性成長預期為中高個位數，較 Q3 實績 (>10%) 保守，表達趨於正常化但仍穩健（ZTS 2025‑Q3: "10%" 作為比較參考）。

- 2025 CAG 診斷價格實現展望（4%–4.5% 貢獻）
  - IDXX 明確把 4–4.5% 的全球淨價實現視為可持續貢獻。相比之下，同業通常提及價格／體量混合，但少見像 IDXX 一樣提供穩定百分比的明確指引。

- 2025 InVue Dx 放置與儀器營收展望（約 6,000 台；儀器營收 > $65M）
  - IDXX 提供子產品層級的放置與營收數字，顯示更細緻的量化指引；同業片段中缺少同等細節，故 IDXX 在此呈現更高解像度的商業預期。

- 2025 報告營運利潤率展望（31.6%–31.8%；全年可比改善 80–100 bps）
  - IDXX 提高並收窄營運利潤率指引並量化 bps 改善。此與某些同業（NOW 30.5%）類似；IDXX 同時強調明確的 bps 目標（NOW 2025‑Q1: "30.5%"）。

- Q3 2025 各事業部有機營收成長（CAG 12%，Water 7%，LPD 14%）
  - IDXX 提供分部成長，顯示廣泛動能（LPD 尤其強勁 14%）。同業也會分部報告，但成長幅度多為不同量級（ZTS 畜牧約 10%），IDXX 在部分分部展現更高增速（ZTS 2025‑Q3: "10%"）。

- Q3 2025 VetLab 耗材有機營收成長（+16%）
  - IDXX 強調耗材收入快速成長（+16%），支援經常性收入基礎。可比公司在耗材範疇的數據較少，但 IDXX 顯示出高於許多同業的耗材黏著與成長。

- Q3 2025 Global Reference Lab 有機成長（+9%，比 Q2 加速約 +4%）
  - IDXX 同時報年比與環比加速，凸顯動能改善。可比同業亦會提到服務類加速，但幅度與情況不同，IDXX 特別強調正向趨勢。

- Q3 2025 全球快速檢測（rapid assay）有機營收下降（-5%）
  - IDXX 揭露 -5% 下降，並歸因於部分檢測轉移到儀器平台。類似的產品轉移造成的逆風在同業中也有類似敘述（NKE 提及 mid‑single‑digit headwind），IDXX 做出具體量化（NKE 2025‑Q1: "mid‑single digit headwind"）。

- 快速檢測因胰脂肪酶測試遷移造成的逆風（估計 Q3 營收成長 6% 的逆風）
  - IDXX 直接量化此逆風為 6%。同業也會以「中位數個位數」描述類似投影，IDXX 的明確百分比符合業界習慣但更具體（NKE 2025‑Q1: "mid‑single digit headwind"）。

- Q3 2025 美國同店臨床就診次數（-1.2%）及就診組合（非健康訪視 -0.3pp，健康訪視 -2.5%）
  - IDXX 將就診下滑（-1.2%，健康訪視 -2.5%）歸因於宏觀壓力。這與某些醫療保健同業報告的就診強勁（UNH Q1 2025: 就診「遠高於」前年）形成對比，IDXX 指出獸醫端需求較弱（UNH 2025‑Q1: "Total visits... far above the year‑ago period"）。

- IDEXX 美國 CAG 經常性收入相對就診的成長溢價（約 950 bps）
  - IDXX 強調營收成長遠超於就診（約 9.5 個百分點），用以說明附著率、定價與測試組合的彈性。可比片段中少見此類直接的「溢價 vs 訪視」指標，IDXX 使用差異化 KPI 證明營收韌性。

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

---

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

ORIGINAL EARNINGS CALL TRANSCRIPT:
---
Ana Soro: Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.
Ryan Taylor: We had a monumental third quarter shattering expectations yet again. Our overall revenue grew 63% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. We outperformed across the board, driven by strong execution in the U.S. which accounted for 3/4 of our business in Q3, growing 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Our Rule of 40 score soared to an unprecedented 114%, up 4 points year-over-year and a full 20 points since last quarter alone, reinforcing our position as the defining enterprise software company of our generation. Our U.S. commercial business grew an incredible 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially, driven both by insatiable demand and the quantified exceptionalism compelling customers to scale AIP across their operations. Organizations are embracing an undeniable truth. Real enterprise AI at scale requires Palantir. We're seeing that AIP again and again, is the only platform delivering transformational impact in this market. And critically, AIP is the only AI platform that has an actual plan for compounding your enterprise's AI leverage, not just the model makers' leverage over you. Sharing this leverage with our customers is our highest priority. Our whole company is singularly focused around value creation for our customers, and I'm proud to share with you all the fruits of our labor. We closed our highest TCV quarter ever at $2.8 billion. Underlying this performance, we closed a staggering 204 deals worth $1 million or more of which 91 deals were worth $5 million or more and 53 deals were worth $10 million or more. In our U.S. commercial business, which now accounts for 34% of our overall revenue. We closed $1.3 billion in TCV, a milestone achievement for the fastest-growing area of our business with a more than 6x year-over-year growth rate on a dollar-weighted duration basis. The trajectory is clear. Customers are converting to larger enterprise agreements in short time frames, reflecting both the expanding scope of their AI ambitions and the immediate impact our software delivers. A leading medical device manufacturer signed a multiyear expansion just 5 months after their initial contract, increasing ACV more than eightfold. 2 weeks into their initial contract, the conversation evolved from a single use case to pursuing the opportunity of becoming an AI-first enterprise. Their CEO approached me to embrace a shared vision for an enterprise-wide AIP deployment to transform their entire organization. This transformation reflects a broader pattern we're seeing across our customer base. AI is a strategic imperative owned at the C-suite level with executive leadership recognizing the enterprise-wide AI adoption is the defining factor separating the AI haves and the AI have-nots. We're seeing C-suite-driven AI transformations across our customers. At a leading insurance company, the CEO has taken personal ownership of their AI transformation, meeting with our team regularly to orchestrate a company-wide transformation around AIP, reimagining every function from underwriting to claims processing, leading to a significant expansion of our work together. Our partnership with TWG Global named Vergence.ai continues to gain momentum as TWG's Thomas Tull noted "what was once a competitive advantage is now a competitive necessity." Companies that fail to incorporate AI into their core operations will be outpaced by those that do. These examples underscore what we are seeing. We are the only platform bringing true transformational impact to the enterprise AI market. Turning to our U.S. government business. Revenue grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially as we continue to deliver mission-critical capabilities. We remain deeply committed to our founding mission of supporting the U.S. government honored by the privilege of equipping our nation with transformative software that actually works. We remain focused on delivering the most advanced defense capabilities in the world to the U.S. government and internationally to our allied partners around the world. The momentum we're carrying into Q4 is extraordinary. As we look towards the end of the year, our mission is clear: deliver the production capabilities that turn AI from promise into performance for the enterprises defining the future of their industries through AIP's compounding AI leverage. I'll now turn it over to Shyam.
Shyam Sankar: Thanks, Ryan. 20 years of grinding has built a unique moat and a growing lead. Our products were built for this moment, and the numbers continue to show it. Realizing value from AI in the enterprise requires the elegant integration of LLMs workflow and software. And this is only possible with ontology. Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand now and in the world ahead. The most significant product developments are the accelerating progress in our AI applications inside of AIP, our AIP native development agent that understands how to connect to data sources, how to integrate and transform data, how to create ontologies and functions and build applications. It's unleashing incredible speed and productivity for our FDEs and customer developer is alike. At 1 customer, 2 human FDEs spawned an army of AI FDEs to migrate a customer off their legacy data warehouse in 5 days, something that would have taken an army of SIs up to 2 years. This is not a prototype. This is production across our customers, the results are shocking. AI Hivemind is a new AIP capability that orchestrates a form of a dynamically generated agents to tackle hard problem solving, idea generation refinement and executable proposal generation that is integrated with ontology and therefore, aware of the context of your enterprise. AI Hivemind was originally developed to solve extremely complex problems in the classified space. But it's already been used to help our commercial customers identify bottlenecks in their supply chain, proactively developing possible solutions and then leveraging AI FDE to code that up into an actual solution. In the government space, AI Hivemind is able to take its proposals and generate intricate mission plans right in Gaia and Maverick. Our focus with AIP continues to be enterprise autonomy, our normative view of where the value is for AI in the enterprise. Hivemind now lets the AI develop novel solutions to emergent challenges and to identify hidden opportunities. And the rest of AIP enables you to turn those ideas into an implemented reality. Closed-loop evolution of the business with AI possible because of AIP in ontology. We continue to make investments that allow enterprises to extend AIP to the far edge. Edge Ontology is a new lightweight implementation of ontology that runs on mobile devices. It enables customers to build mobile applications or embedded software for hardware, things like drones and robots and is fully integrated with your enterprises' AIP instance. Turning to field-facing updates. The U.S. Army issued an official public memo directing all army organizations to consolidate and centralize on Vantage, the Army data platform built on foundry and AIP. The Army views this, not merely as a technical decision, but a cultural decision, enabling the data-driven decision-making that continues to make our army the most lethal in the world. This directive will enable the Army to rapidly sunset legacy systems and enable more investment in the Army's Future Force concept and systems. Warp Speed and the American Tech Fellowship are early investments to support manufacturing and reindustrialization in America are bearing fruit. While Warp Speed launched by helping new defense entrants meet their surging production goals, it's now being rapidly adopted across the traditional defense industrial base and the maritime industrial base. The second cohort of the American Tech Fellowship will be wrapping up in the next few weeks. We started the American Tech Fellowship because we noticed that many of our best builders were frontline workers. They don't come from conventional consulting backgrounds. They don't have formal computer science backgrounds. To highlight a few of these folks, Mason, a Louisiana-based civil engineer is building AI applications for more accurate estimates for heavy construction projects, something that is only going to grow with our reindustrialization. Michael, who works for a potato farm in North Dakota is streamlining its operations and Cody from Georgia, who is a utilities expert is building in foundry to deliver safe, reliable energy across the South. These Americans are the true face of innovation, underscoring that it will be the American worker with AI that drives reindustrialization and American prosperity. Our customers have taken notice and asked us to create American tech fellowship programs for their employees, specifically to include Lear who highlighted their fellowship in their recent earnings call. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers.
David Glazer: Thanks, Shyam. We had an outstanding third quarter achieving a Rule of 40 score of 114%, our highest ever by 20 points. We also generated our highest ever reported revenue growth rate of 63% year-over-year exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by 1,300 basis points and representing a 3,300 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q3 of last year. On the back of this extraordinary strength, we are guiding to revenue of $1.329 billion in the fourth quarter, representing 13% growth quarter-over-quarter, our highest-ever sequential revenue growth guide and 61% growth year-over-year. We're also raising our full year 2025 revenue guidance midpoint to $4.398 billion, representing a 53% year-over-year growth rate and 8-point or $252 million increase over our full year 2025 revenue guidance last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.433 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 104% year-over-year, a 19-point increase over the guidance we gave just last quarter. Accelerating demand for AIP continues to drive the outperformance in our U.S. business overall, which grew 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially in the third quarter. Our U.S. commercial business grew 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially and our U.S. government business grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. We delivered these exceptional top line results while also achieving our highest ever reported adjusted operating margin of 51%, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by 500 basis points and highlighting the unit economics of our business at scale. Our revenue and profitability drove a 20-point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score from 94% in the second quarter to 114% in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the first time in the company's history. Turning to our global top line results. Third quarter revenue grew 63% year-over-year and 18% sequentially to $1.181 billion. Third quarter U.S. revenue grew 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $883 million. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter revenue grew 65% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, and third quarter U.S. revenue grew 78% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. We closed our highest ever quarter of TCV bookings at $2.8 billion, up 151% year-over-year. This eclipses our prior highest quarter of TCV bookings just last quarter by nearly $0.5 billion. Customer count grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to 911 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Third quarter trailing 12 months revenue from our top 20 customers increased 38% year-over-year to $83 million per customer. Now moving to our commercial segment. Third quarter commercial revenue grew 73% year-over-year and 22% sequentially to $548 million. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that revenue from our commercial business has been larger than our U.S. government business. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter commercial revenue grew 77% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. We closed $1.4 billion in commercial TCV bookings representing 132% growth year-over-year and 32% sequentially. AIP continues to drive existing customer expansions and new customer conversions in the U.S. Third quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to $397 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 126% year-over-year and 29% sequentially. In the third quarter, we closed $1.3 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings representing growth of 342% year-over-year and surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Over the past 12 months, we closed $3.8 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings a 217% increase from the prior 12 months, highlighting the demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 199% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 530 customers, reflecting growth of 65% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Third quarter international commercial revenue grew 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $152 million. For international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond but remain focused on accelerating the growth in our U.S. business. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $2.9 million for the quarter. We anticipate fourth quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to be between $2 million to $4 million compared to $9.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to be less than half of 1% of full year revenue. Shifting to our Government segment. Third quarter government revenue grew 55% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $633 million. Third quarter U.S. government revenue grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $486 million. This growth was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI and our government software offerings. Third quarter international government revenue grew 66% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $147 million, bolstered primarily by our continued work in the U.K. As previously mentioned, we closed our highest ever quarter of TCV bookings at $2.8 billion, up 151% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 134%, an increase of 600 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions of existing customers and new customers acquired in Q3 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution. As net dollar tension does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration and velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the third quarter with $8.6 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 91% year-over-year and 21% sequentially and $2.6 billion in the remaining performance obligations, an increase of 66% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 84% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $601 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 51%. Q3 adjusted expense was $581 million, up [ 8% ] sequentially and 29% year-over-year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical hiring. We continue to expect expenses to increase in the fourth quarter as we remain committed to investing in the product pipeline and the most elite technical talent, all while delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability. Third quarter GAAP operating income was $393 million, representing a 33% margin. Third quarter GAAP net income was $476 million, representing a 40% margin. Third quarter stock-based compensation expense was $172 million and equity-related employer payroll tax expense was $35 million. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.18. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.21. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 114% in the third quarter, a 20-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter and our ninth consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 score. With the increase in our 2025 revenue and adjusted operating income guidance, we are now guiding to a Rule of 40 score of 102% for the full year. Turning to our cash flow. In the third quarter, we generated $508 million in cash from operations and $540 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 43% and 46%, respectively. Additionally, we achieved $2 billion in trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow for the first time. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $880 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Now turning to our outlook. For Q4 2025, we expect revenue of between $1.327 billion and $1.331 billion and adjusted income from operations of between $695 million and $699 million. For full year 2025, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $4.396 billion and $4.400 billion. We are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.433 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 104%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $2.151 billion and $2.155 billion, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.
Alexander Karp: Greetings. By any normal or even reasonable standard, these are not normal results. These are not even strong results. These aren't extraordinary results. These are arguably the best results that any software company has ever delivered. And that's not hyperbolic, despite what your analyst friends may want you to believe because they've been wrong at every price, they're wrong in every -- at every single round. But of course, they're perspective and they're not investing our own money. But a normal enterprise company should not have a Rule of 40 above 100%. A normal enterprise company at our base should not have over 100% U.S. commercial growth should not have 77% growth in the U.S. And by the way, that growth is being held down by a stagnant Europe, which is still a significant part of our business. So the pure unvarnished numbers are 77% growth off of a massive significant base with very significant cash flow with a company that throws off a Rule of 40 of 114%. And then if this world was at all sane, every single person in the financial world would stop and say, how did this happen? How did a company, which stood by the American Warfighter, marine special operators, people in clandestine services who stood up for a right of free speech and was really the first company to be completely anti-woke. How did this company stick up for the American Warfighter, actually give normal Americans venture quality results. So one of the issues we have with the arbiters of truth is, it was the American worker that we supported and the American worker that we helped make rich. And arbiters of truth somehow did not participate in that because they were such experts. And of course -- but what these numbers show is doing that and taking the American worker along with it and doing it in a way that foreshadowed the future FDE, ontology foundry, making each specific institution, making the American Warfighter fight the way the American Warfighter is born to fight. Empowering the [ tenets ] of being free and having the ability to do creative things in the battlefield context and then taking enterprises instead of selling them commodity parasitic software with a massive sales force with a kind of lumbering jargon-bearing leaders, offering you stakes and dinners and other things we shall not mention in order that you turn the value -- the high-value revenue of your enterprise over to them in return for these accolades, we created direct alignment with our customers. And what does that mean? It means when our customers have a unique and triable way of doing something, whether it's underwriting or fighting or making workers even more valuable. We put an FDE, we orchestrated in ontology. We take tribal understanding of their business, the specific nature of their business that makes them particular and valuable and lethal and we empower that. And how do we participate in that? Unlike seemingly in the most obvious way, we are downstream from the value creation. So when you see 141% or you see 77% or 63% and you ask, and by the way, with really a workforce that is not growing in any way linearly proportional to that growth and also with a sales force which is declining, which seems improbable. The reason why that's working is because we are making our clients more money or we're making them more dominant on the battlefield, and they're paying us a subset of that. And this is why these numbers are so extraordinary. The sociological and political version of this should be, wait a minute, how can we learn from this? How can we implement institutions? By the way, we have all these people talking about AI [indiscernible]. I'll tell you what 114% proves. There is a massive part of the AI market that actually cares about value creation, and that's the part we own. And we own that part because to do this, you have to have [ FDE ] orchestration, you have to have ontology and you have to have foundry and you have to have access to the game, and you have to have a deep understanding of how to do that. And you have to have done this for a very, very long time with products, by the way, and then the products are getting better and better and better and better. And I'll let Shyam talk about what we're doing on the battlefield to the extent that he can, but you see the very similar trajectory where we're giving America, both in industry and in government, a massive, unfair advantage. And again, you see it like if you look at our numbers, look at how poorly Europe is doing. Look how well America is doing. Look how we're doing this. And again, it's not just top line. The Rule of 114 that we have shows top line and bottom line growth that is distinctive, massive and unique. And on top of everything else, there is this issue in the U.S. that we're all focused on at Palantir which is what access -- what portion of the GDP growth that we're blessed to have in this country, meaning GDP growth defined or helped out and bolstered by AI. What percentage of that is available to the American worker. And so when we're -- AI -- GDP availability for the American worker, meaning, do they participate in this growth? Or is it just people around this table who are getting richer and richer. And then you see our platform on the battlefield, as Shyam was mentioning, the people doing the coding in AIP are vocationally trained smart Americans with specific knowledge. They don't have -- and actually, and you have people on the factory floor, very same thing. People across the nation, truck drivers. Anybody with specific domain expertise is more powerful, more valuable in our product than they were yesterday. In fact, the real misalignment of AI is with people with commodity like high-trained elite institution, general specialists, that's just not as valuable as it was. And yes, the destructive -- positive destruction of capitalism is going to put that class of people. Typically, the class of people that also is kind of skeptical of Palantir under enormous pressure. But it is our -- what I see in these numbers and what I think we see in these numbers is to be -- put it slightly over the top. Yes, we were right, you were wrong. And we are going to go very, very deep on our rightness because it is exceedingly good for America. It's exceedingly good for the American economy. It's as good for American workers. And you know what, I really enjoy turning on TV and seeing some analysts explain why some other company is better than ours simply because they didn't make any on our company and probably aren't. And we're just going to keep going and going and going. And then we're obviously not going to forecast for next year. But I would say, if you're thinking about how this company is going to go, look at our ability to value create, look at our ability to create revenue on the top end, look at it -- look at the unit economics of our business. If you're a technical expert in how do you evaluate business, evaluate those numbers against any other business you've ever seen and then make your decision. But yes, I'm wildly enthusiastic. I think we're wildly enthusiastic. And thank you for those of you who stayed with us to enjoy these numbers, especially Palantirians who work day and night to deliver these kind of numbers.
Ana Soro: Thank you, Alex. We'll now turn to questions from our shareholders before opening up the call. We received a few questions asking what do you see as Palantir's unique differentiator that others may not understand?
Shyam Sankar: Well, Alex mentioned a bit of this here. It's become fashionable actually for lots of companies to start hiring FDEs. The Financial Times had an article about how it's the most popular new job title. But what you see is that they don't really understand it. It's just mimetic. And if you -- everything Alex, you said, like we build software that works, that not software that ought to work. We build software for the world as it exists, not a world that never was. And this ability to find what's true, that comes from the FDE. Our measure of success is not did we sell the software, it's did we solve the problem. And we have built an entire software stack over 2 decades, downstream of creating value for our customers. That led to the ontology a decade ago, more than a decade ago, which is a fundamental prerequisite to getting value out of LLMs in the enterprise. In this past year, it led to AI Hivemind and AI FDE.
Alexander Karp: The other thing, which like is implicit in that is the way we work puts us -- forces us to go up the chain of complexity every day. So we're taking on the most painful, most integral, most valuable parts of the stack in every enterprise. And it's precisely because like that's the way we actually lever our ability to deploy and orchestrate FDEs. That's the way we make our products stronger. And quite frankly, that's the way we produce these numbers because the closer you are to the front line of the very complex problem that a black box was not meant to solve, cannot solve. And at this point, everyone knows a joke to believe it could solve, that's where you -- and by the way, it's the safest position for us because this company, we will always believe that we are outsiders. We need to be in the place where the most valuable problem is being solved because that's the way we end up staying, solving the problem tomorrow and the way we get paid.
Ana Soro: Thank you both. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. [Operator Instructions].
Daniel Ives: Look, obviously, another monster quarter for you guys, congrats. So my question for you is for Alex and team. What -- can you just walk through just the accelerated sales cycles that you're seeing from so many companies that have gone to the boot camps? Like what surprised you from when they come to you at that first sort of contact to now actually launching deals. I mean, maybe you could talk about that just in terms of everything you're seeing anecdotally.
Ryan Taylor: Thanks, Dan. So I think we look at U.S. commercial. We closed $1.3 billion in TCV at 6x on a dollar-weighted duration basis from what it was a year ago. And of those deals worth 83 were worth of $1 million or more 40 were $5 million or more, the 21 deals were $10 million or more. I've been involved in a lot of those directly. I'm feeling exactly what you're asking on the ground from customers. And what's happening now is from the C-suite across the company, customers are coming to us looking to not just say, let's do a use case. The customers who are having the most impact are coming to us saying, how do we deploy this across our entire organization, how do we reorganize our entire organization around Palantir and AIP. And that's what's happening on the ground. And we're singularly focused on delivering the value to the customers, and that's our go-to-market. How do we get the product to them and deliver...
Alexander Karp: Where Ryan is like really very much on the front line here is there's both how many customers approach you. I think where we're seeing the biggest shift is the customers who've approached us very quickly want to move to how would I change my enterprise to express it in a way that's most valuable according to my terms in your product? And then one -- and literally want a reorg, a short-hand version that we often use is you used to have to take a company private to change the unit economics of it. Basically, just like we're providing venture results, high-end venture results to normal investors in the last couple of years, what we're doing actually in enterprise is, is providing a private equity like transformation in the public markets, in the public space under the current leadership. And that's essentially what our best -- and by the way, the other thing Ryan would tell you about is our newer clients have much higher expectations of us. Like they're like, essentially, I want to transform my business. I want to do it in months. I want to do it in the public eye, while being in the public market, mostly not exclusively. And I want you to not only do the product side but also tell us how would you actually implement AI, foundry, ontology, FDE model and our tribal knowledge to do that. And it's a completely different game. We used to have to beg and plead to be like -- when we first started talking, we were begging and pleading to be at the margin of a problem that could affect a subset of the business. By the way, Shyam, it's like, unfortunately, can only tell you 1% what he's involved in. But this is like exactly the same in the U.S. government around the world. It's like the things that we're sitting on and working on are like crazy, crazy and important and are not downstream of the problem. They are the problem, and we're reshaping them.
Ana Soro: Thank you both. Our next question from Mariana with Bank of America.
Mariana Perez Mora: I'm going to do, as usual, a couple of questions, one on commercial, one on defense or government. On commercial, I'd like to follow up to Dan's question. And let's see if you can discuss what changed from a behavioral perspective, from a customer perspective to see this accelerated appetite to incorporate Palantir to not only accelerating how many customers you have, but also the existing customers go to -- go up the value chain. And what changed internally as well? We recently saw in a visit the like AI agents or AI FDE is, like how are you incorporating tech internally to be able to accelerate and catch up with that demand? And on the government side, U.S. government up 50% plus is really impressive. And how do you think about opportunities like Golden Dome going forward adding up to this?
Alexander Karp: Well, you guys want to answer these questions? I think that there's an external one, which is like what does it feel like? That's clearly you. The internal one is a really subtle question. And I don't know anyone should jump in there? And then obviously, you should have Shyam opine on.
Shyam Sankar: Yes. Well, do you want to start with commercial or...
Ryan Taylor: Sure. Yes. I think on the external, I think it's like going deeper and deeper and more and more like tangible results with customers where they're -- there's a network effect in coming, like customer sharing impact that we're having and direct impact we're having with customers. Customers are seeing as we -- it's a continuation of what we've been doing, but going deeper and deeper with the customers on that impact. And I think that what we're seeing is more and more are now coming to us saying -- and the ones that are most impactful are coming to us saying, let's do more.
Alexander Karp: Ryan is our best at being a wonderful -- I'll just give a vulgar version here. Our clients realize the choice is suck basically. And they've tried a lot of stuff. It hasn't worked. And then we're in so many verticals. We're -- let's just say, we're in vertical 252 and we dominate for one customer. People see that. And then they're like, "Oh, well, I'll try this with some, I don't know, knock off half fake thing. It's just like -- and then a lot of people really still don't understand that are still trying to do this long migration where LLMs are going to perform as if they're LLMs and ontology. And as if they are LLMs were not a commodity. And then -- but then in the marketplace, they see the final result of someone else using ontology, foundry, FDE. And now it's like, wait a minute, I'm paying hundreds of millions of dollars in getting nothing. And the person down the road, I kind of looked down on is way ahead of me and their unit economics are transforming overnight. And that just shifts the whole conversation because then we're like, okay, well, if you want it to work, you can have to do these 5 things. And these things are like you're going to have to talk to Ryan and they're going to have to -- I don't know, occasionally meet with me, and you're going to have to actually allow us to come in with engineers. And you're going to -- we're going to have to actually work on the problems that are valuable for your business and also look at the costs that are dragging you down. By the way, the cost for most businesses is not just the actual money they're wasting. That wasted money creates an ecosystem of waste. They're talking to all these vendors all the time about all these things will never work instead of solving the problem. And so like -- and so getting the pathogens out of their business is a real issue, and now they're really, really interested in this. And so -- and then on the internal front, I would say it's just we have to double down. The most important thing for us internally is with all this success, we do not want to give up the unique attributes of Palantir and somehow purchase fake ways for us that are artificial for us. And so making sure we are very, very close to the problem and making sure everyone here, like if you heard our internal dialogue, it's much more like who's on the factory floor here. What are we doing internally? How do we make sure our products are better and better? How do we make sure, say, Shyam is a savant at going around and figuring out what the underlying tech issue is, how are we making sure we have the best product team and the very, very exact right fit for every single deployment across our deployments that we care about, especially mission deployments, which we highly, highly overvalue in terms of our time and energy. And like how do you make sure Palantir stays as tribal and cultus and unique as it was 20 years ago? How do we double and triple down on that? And how do we recruit the right people. And then internally, we have, look, we power ICE, we power efforts to defend America and Ukraine and with allies. We're on the front line of all adversaries, including vis-a-vis China. And we support -- we're at ICE and we're -- we've supported Israel. Okay. These are very controversies. I don't know why this is all controversial, but many people find that controversial. Okay? So how do you align people to focus on these things in a way that is actually beneficial for us and our clients. These are really hard and tricky issues that we spend a lot of time. I would say, as an overarching thing, because what we found is the more we focus on our internal dynamics, the better our numbers are. That's why we have less salespeople, and we have 77% growth in 75% of our market, 121% growth in U.S. comp. Please tell that to some of your friends. I don't even understand how they can look at these numbers and not drop the key out of their [ Immortal Six ] and just like say, I mean, they're like they're fantastic numbers but it's like internal focus.
Shyam Sankar: I'll make the mistake of trying to follow Alex there and just say on the internal side with AIFDE, that's why we actually originally built it. Our headcount has grown roughly 10%, but revenue grew 63%. How are we doing that? We've made our FDEs wildly more productive. And I mean, so much so that we decided to give it to our customers. And we've started to make our customers more productive. When you have a note like the Army Vantage note, where the Army is consolidating into the Army data platform, you now have an army, literal army of green suiters who need to become proficient developers in the software. And you have a generation of green suiters whose first interaction with the software is going to be with AI FDE. They're going to be super heroes on day 1. I think that it's accelerating adoption. It's accelerating understanding like the depth of adoption, not just are you using it, but how much of it are you really using? How much of it can you understand? And then quickly on your comment on the U.S. government business, like, yes, the number of opportunities out there are great. I can't comment on all the opportunities you mentioned there, but whether it's NGC2, the continued growth of, Maven, I mean we have, of course, America is involved with 3 conflicts right now in the world from Europe, the Middle East and in our own hemisphere right now. And things are getting a little spicy. By the way, let me say something slightly political, and I'm not saying other people agree with this. But when people are attacking our soldiers for stopping fentanyl from coming to this country, I want people to remember, if fentanyl was killing 60,000 Yale grads instead of 60,000 working class people, we'd be dropping a nuclear bomb on whoever was sending it for South America. So it's slightly -- like we -- in this -- at Palantir, we are on the side of the American -- average American who sometimes gets screwed because all the empathy goes to elite people and none of it goes to the people who are actually dying on our streets. And that's why it's like when you have an open border, it means that the average poor American earns less. I know my fellow progressives believe having an open border is going to make things, but that's because they're actually repping elite people instead of the working class. And the same thing in South America, is like to believe our constitution does not give us the right to stop 60,000 deaths a year of working class men and women is insane. And this company -- this country is right to stop that. And I am very proud. I don't know all the efforts we're involved in, but to the extent we're involved in these efforts, I and most Palantirians are very proud of this.
Ana Soro: Thank you. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call?
Alexander Karp: We're rocking along. Please turn on the conventional television and see how unhappy those that didn't invest in us are, enjoy get some popcorn, they're crying. We are every day making this company better, and we're doing it for this nation, for allied countries and also for -- and I never really like the term retail investors. How about same people who put up their own money and fight for us -- and by the way, you are fighting for the right side of what should work in this country, meritocracy, lethal technology vis-a-vis adversaries, products that spread GDP to working-class women, men and women by making their value creation higher and by the way, your bank account. And thank you for that.
Ana Soro: Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.

Original transcript:
Ana Soro: Good afternoon. I'm Ana Soro from Palantir's finance team, and I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. We'll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward-looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 results, management's expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Further, during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from GAAP measures. Additional information about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today's call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer; Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer; Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I'll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.
Ryan Taylor: We had a monumental third quarter shattering expectations yet again. Our overall revenue grew 63% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. We outperformed across the board, driven by strong execution in the U.S. which accounted for 3/4 of our business in Q3, growing 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Our Rule of 40 score soared to an unprecedented 114%, up 4 points year-over-year and a full 20 points since last quarter alone, reinforcing our position as the defining enterprise software company of our generation. Our U.S. commercial business grew an incredible 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially, driven both by insatiable demand and the quantified exceptionalism compelling customers to scale AIP across their operations. Organizations are embracing an undeniable truth. Real enterprise AI at scale requires Palantir. We're seeing that AIP again and again, is the only platform delivering transformational impact in this market. And critically, AIP is the only AI platform that has an actual plan for compounding your enterprise's AI leverage, not just the model makers' leverage over you. Sharing this leverage with our customers is our highest priority. Our whole company is singularly focused around value creation for our customers, and I'm proud to share with you all the fruits of our labor. We closed our highest TCV quarter ever at $2.8 billion. Underlying this performance, we closed a staggering 204 deals worth $1 million or more of which 91 deals were worth $5 million or more and 53 deals were worth $10 million or more. In our U.S. commercial business, which now accounts for 34% of our overall revenue. We closed $1.3 billion in TCV, a milestone achievement for the fastest-growing area of our business with a more than 6x year-over-year growth rate on a dollar-weighted duration basis. The trajectory is clear. Customers are converting to larger enterprise agreements in short time frames, reflecting both the expanding scope of their AI ambitions and the immediate impact our software delivers. A leading medical device manufacturer signed a multiyear expansion just 5 months after their initial contract, increasing ACV more than eightfold. 2 weeks into their initial contract, the conversation evolved from a single use case to pursuing the opportunity of becoming an AI-first enterprise. Their CEO approached me to embrace a shared vision for an enterprise-wide AIP deployment to transform their entire organization. This transformation reflects a broader pattern we're seeing across our customer base. AI is a strategic imperative owned at the C-suite level with executive leadership recognizing the enterprise-wide AI adoption is the defining factor separating the AI haves and the AI have-nots. We're seeing C-suite-driven AI transformations across our customers. At a leading insurance company, the CEO has taken personal ownership of their AI transformation, meeting with our team regularly to orchestrate a company-wide transformation around AIP, reimagining every function from underwriting to claims processing, leading to a significant expansion of our work together. Our partnership with TWG Global named Vergence.ai continues to gain momentum as TWG's Thomas Tull noted "what was once a competitive advantage is now a competitive necessity." Companies that fail to incorporate AI into their core operations will be outpaced by those that do. These examples underscore what we are seeing. We are the only platform bringing true transformational impact to the enterprise AI market. Turning to our U.S. government business. Revenue grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially as we continue to deliver mission-critical capabilities. We remain deeply committed to our founding mission of supporting the U.S. government honored by the privilege of equipping our nation with transformative software that actually works. We remain focused on delivering the most advanced defense capabilities in the world to the U.S. government and internationally to our allied partners around the world. The momentum we're carrying into Q4 is extraordinary. As we look towards the end of the year, our mission is clear: deliver the production capabilities that turn AI from promise into performance for the enterprises defining the future of their industries through AIP's compounding AI leverage. I'll now turn it over to Shyam.
Shyam Sankar: Thanks, Ryan. 20 years of grinding has built a unique moat and a growing lead. Our products were built for this moment, and the numbers continue to show it. Realizing value from AI in the enterprise requires the elegant integration of LLMs workflow and software. And this is only possible with ontology. Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on AI demand now and in the world ahead. The most significant product developments are the accelerating progress in our AI applications inside of AIP, our AIP native development agent that understands how to connect to data sources, how to integrate and transform data, how to create ontologies and functions and build applications. It's unleashing incredible speed and productivity for our FDEs and customer developer is alike. At 1 customer, 2 human FDEs spawned an army of AI FDEs to migrate a customer off their legacy data warehouse in 5 days, something that would have taken an army of SIs up to 2 years. This is not a prototype. This is production across our customers, the results are shocking. AI Hivemind is a new AIP capability that orchestrates a form of a dynamically generated agents to tackle hard problem solving, idea generation refinement and executable proposal generation that is integrated with ontology and therefore, aware of the context of your enterprise. AI Hivemind was originally developed to solve extremely complex problems in the classified space. But it's already been used to help our commercial customers identify bottlenecks in their supply chain, proactively developing possible solutions and then leveraging AI FDE to code that up into an actual solution. In the government space, AI Hivemind is able to take its proposals and generate intricate mission plans right in Gaia and Maverick. Our focus with AIP continues to be enterprise autonomy, our normative view of where the value is for AI in the enterprise. Hivemind now lets the AI develop novel solutions to emergent challenges and to identify hidden opportunities. And the rest of AIP enables you to turn those ideas into an implemented reality. Closed-loop evolution of the business with AI possible because of AIP in ontology. We continue to make investments that allow enterprises to extend AIP to the far edge. Edge Ontology is a new lightweight implementation of ontology that runs on mobile devices. It enables customers to build mobile applications or embedded software for hardware, things like drones and robots and is fully integrated with your enterprises' AIP instance. Turning to field-facing updates. The U.S. Army issued an official public memo directing all army organizations to consolidate and centralize on Vantage, the Army data platform built on foundry and AIP. The Army views this, not merely as a technical decision, but a cultural decision, enabling the data-driven decision-making that continues to make our army the most lethal in the world. This directive will enable the Army to rapidly sunset legacy systems and enable more investment in the Army's Future Force concept and systems. Warp Speed and the American Tech Fellowship are early investments to support manufacturing and reindustrialization in America are bearing fruit. While Warp Speed launched by helping new defense entrants meet their surging production goals, it's now being rapidly adopted across the traditional defense industrial base and the maritime industrial base. The second cohort of the American Tech Fellowship will be wrapping up in the next few weeks. We started the American Tech Fellowship because we noticed that many of our best builders were frontline workers. They don't come from conventional consulting backgrounds. They don't have formal computer science backgrounds. To highlight a few of these folks, Mason, a Louisiana-based civil engineer is building AI applications for more accurate estimates for heavy construction projects, something that is only going to grow with our reindustrialization. Michael, who works for a potato farm in North Dakota is streamlining its operations and Cody from Georgia, who is a utilities expert is building in foundry to deliver safe, reliable energy across the South. These Americans are the true face of innovation, underscoring that it will be the American worker with AI that drives reindustrialization and American prosperity. Our customers have taken notice and asked us to create American tech fellowship programs for their employees, specifically to include Lear who highlighted their fellowship in their recent earnings call. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers.
David Glazer: Thanks, Shyam. We had an outstanding third quarter achieving a Rule of 40 score of 114%, our highest ever by 20 points. We also generated our highest ever reported revenue growth rate of 63% year-over-year exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by 1,300 basis points and representing a 3,300 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q3 of last year. On the back of this extraordinary strength, we are guiding to revenue of $1.329 billion in the fourth quarter, representing 13% growth quarter-over-quarter, our highest-ever sequential revenue growth guide and 61% growth year-over-year. We're also raising our full year 2025 revenue guidance midpoint to $4.398 billion, representing a 53% year-over-year growth rate and 8-point or $252 million increase over our full year 2025 revenue guidance last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.433 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 104% year-over-year, a 19-point increase over the guidance we gave just last quarter. Accelerating demand for AIP continues to drive the outperformance in our U.S. business overall, which grew 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially in the third quarter. Our U.S. commercial business grew 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially and our U.S. government business grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. We delivered these exceptional top line results while also achieving our highest ever reported adjusted operating margin of 51%, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by 500 basis points and highlighting the unit economics of our business at scale. Our revenue and profitability drove a 20-point sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score from 94% in the second quarter to 114% in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the first time in the company's history. Turning to our global top line results. Third quarter revenue grew 63% year-over-year and 18% sequentially to $1.181 billion. Third quarter U.S. revenue grew 77% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $883 million. Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter revenue grew 65% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, and third quarter U.S. revenue grew 78% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. We closed our highest ever quarter of TCV bookings at $2.8 billion, up 151% year-over-year. This eclipses our prior highest quarter of TCV bookings just last quarter by nearly $0.5 billion. Customer count grew 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially to 911 customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Third quarter trailing 12 months revenue from our top 20 customers increased 38% year-over-year to $83 million per customer. Now moving to our commercial segment. Third quarter commercial revenue grew 73% year-over-year and 22% sequentially to $548 million. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that revenue from our commercial business has been larger than our U.S. government business. Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter commercial revenue grew 77% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. We closed $1.4 billion in commercial TCV bookings representing 132% growth year-over-year and 32% sequentially. AIP continues to drive existing customer expansions and new customer conversions in the U.S. Third quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 121% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to $397 million. Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, third quarter U.S. commercial revenue grew 126% year-over-year and 29% sequentially. In the third quarter, we closed $1.3 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings representing growth of 342% year-over-year and surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Over the past 12 months, we closed $3.8 billion of U.S. commercial TCV bookings a 217% increase from the prior 12 months, highlighting the demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U.S. commercial business grew 199% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. Our U.S. commercial customer count grew to 530 customers, reflecting growth of 65% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Third quarter international commercial revenue grew 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $152 million. For international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and beyond but remain focused on accelerating the growth in our U.S. business. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $2.9 million for the quarter. We anticipate fourth quarter 2025 revenue from these contracts to be between $2 million to $4 million compared to $9.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to be less than half of 1% of full year revenue. Shifting to our Government segment. Third quarter government revenue grew 55% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $633 million. Third quarter U.S. government revenue grew 52% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $486 million. This growth was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI and our government software offerings. Third quarter international government revenue grew 66% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $147 million, bolstered primarily by our continued work in the U.K. As previously mentioned, we closed our highest ever quarter of TCV bookings at $2.8 billion, up 151% year-over-year. Net dollar retention was 134%, an increase of 600 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions of existing customers and new customers acquired in Q3 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution. As net dollar tension does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past 12 months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration and velocity in our U.S. business over the past year. We ended the third quarter with $8.6 billion in total remaining deal value, an increase of 91% year-over-year and 21% sequentially and $2.6 billion in the remaining performance obligations, an increase of 66% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than 12 months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, was 84% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes was $601 million, representing adjusted operating margin of 51%. Q3 adjusted expense was $581 million, up [ 8% ] sequentially and 29% year-over-year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical hiring. We continue to expect expenses to increase in the fourth quarter as we remain committed to investing in the product pipeline and the most elite technical talent, all while delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability. Third quarter GAAP operating income was $393 million, representing a 33% margin. Third quarter GAAP net income was $476 million, representing a 40% margin. Third quarter stock-based compensation expense was $172 million and equity-related employer payroll tax expense was $35 million. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.18. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.21. Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 114% in the third quarter, a 20-point increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter and our ninth consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 score. With the increase in our 2025 revenue and adjusted operating income guidance, we are now guiding to a Rule of 40 score of 102% for the full year. Turning to our cash flow. In the third quarter, we generated $508 million in cash from operations and $540 million in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 43% and 46%, respectively. Additionally, we achieved $2 billion in trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow for the first time. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $880 million remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury securities. Now turning to our outlook. For Q4 2025, we expect revenue of between $1.327 billion and $1.331 billion and adjusted income from operations of between $695 million and $699 million. For full year 2025, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $4.396 billion and $4.400 billion. We are raising our U.S. commercial revenue guidance to an excess of $1.433 billion, representing a growth rate of at least 104%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between $2.151 billion and $2.155 billion, we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Ana will kick off the Q&A.
Alexander Karp: Greetings. By any normal or even reasonable standard, these are not normal results. These are not even strong results. These aren't extraordinary results. These are arguably the best results that any software company has ever delivered. And that's not hyperbolic, despite what your analyst friends may want you to believe because they've been wrong at every price, they're wrong in every -- at every single round. But of course, they're perspective and they're not investing our own money. But a normal enterprise company should not have a Rule of 40 above 100%. A normal enterprise company at our base should not have over 100% U.S. commercial growth should not have 77% growth in the U.S. And by the way, that growth is being held down by a stagnant Europe, which is still a significant part of our business. So the pure unvarnished numbers are 77% growth off of a massive significant base with very significant cash flow with a company that throws off a Rule of 40 of 114%. And then if this world was at all sane, every single person in the financial world would stop and say, how did this happen? How did a company, which stood by the American Warfighter, marine special operators, people in clandestine services who stood up for a right of free speech and was really the first company to be completely anti-woke. How did this company stick up for the American Warfighter, actually give normal Americans venture quality results. So one of the issues we have with the arbiters of truth is, it was the American worker that we supported and the American worker that we helped make rich. And arbiters of truth somehow did not participate in that because they were such experts. And of course -- but what these numbers show is doing that and taking the American worker along with it and doing it in a way that foreshadowed the future FDE, ontology foundry, making each specific institution, making the American Warfighter fight the way the American Warfighter is born to fight. Empowering the [ tenets ] of being free and having the ability to do creative things in the battlefield context and then taking enterprises instead of selling them commodity parasitic software with a massive sales force with a kind of lumbering jargon-bearing leaders, offering you stakes and dinners and other things we shall not mention in order that you turn the value -- the high-value revenue of your enterprise over to them in return for these accolades, we created direct alignment with our customers. And what does that mean? It means when our customers have a unique and triable way of doing something, whether it's underwriting or fighting or making workers even more valuable. We put an FDE, we orchestrated in ontology. We take tribal understanding of their business, the specific nature of their business that makes them particular and valuable and lethal and we empower that. And how do we participate in that? Unlike seemingly in the most obvious way, we are downstream from the value creation. So when you see 141% or you see 77% or 63% and you ask, and by the way, with really a workforce that is not growing in any way linearly proportional to that growth and also with a sales force which is declining, which seems improbable. The reason why that's working is because we are making our clients more money or we're making them more dominant on the battlefield, and they're paying us a subset of that. And this is why these numbers are so extraordinary. The sociological and political version of this should be, wait a minute, how can we learn from this? How can we implement institutions? By the way, we have all these people talking about AI [indiscernible]. I'll tell you what 114% proves. There is a massive part of the AI market that actually cares about value creation, and that's the part we own. And we own that part because to do this, you have to have [ FDE ] orchestration, you have to have ontology and you have to have foundry and you have to have access to the game, and you have to have a deep understanding of how to do that. And you have to have done this for a very, very long time with products, by the way, and then the products are getting better and better and better and better. And I'll let Shyam talk about what we're doing on the battlefield to the extent that he can, but you see the very similar trajectory where we're giving America, both in industry and in government, a massive, unfair advantage. And again, you see it like if you look at our numbers, look at how poorly Europe is doing. Look how well America is doing. Look how we're doing this. And again, it's not just top line. The Rule of 114 that we have shows top line and bottom line growth that is distinctive, massive and unique. And on top of everything else, there is this issue in the U.S. that we're all focused on at Palantir which is what access -- what portion of the GDP growth that we're blessed to have in this country, meaning GDP growth defined or helped out and bolstered by AI. What percentage of that is available to the American worker. And so when we're -- AI -- GDP availability for the American worker, meaning, do they participate in this growth? Or is it just people around this table who are getting richer and richer. And then you see our platform on the battlefield, as Shyam was mentioning, the people doing the coding in AIP are vocationally trained smart Americans with specific knowledge. They don't have -- and actually, and you have people on the factory floor, very same thing. People across the nation, truck drivers. Anybody with specific domain expertise is more powerful, more valuable in our product than they were yesterday. In fact, the real misalignment of AI is with people with commodity like high-trained elite institution, general specialists, that's just not as valuable as it was. And yes, the destructive -- positive destruction of capitalism is going to put that class of people. Typically, the class of people that also is kind of skeptical of Palantir under enormous pressure. But it is our -- what I see in these numbers and what I think we see in these numbers is to be -- put it slightly over the top. Yes, we were right, you were wrong. And we are going to go very, very deep on our rightness because it is exceedingly good for America. It's exceedingly good for the American economy. It's as good for American workers. And you know what, I really enjoy turning on TV and seeing some analysts explain why some other company is better than ours simply because they didn't make any on our company and probably aren't. And we're just going to keep going and going and going. And then we're obviously not going to forecast for next year. But I would say, if you're thinking about how this company is going to go, look at our ability to value create, look at our ability to create revenue on the top end, look at it -- look at the unit economics of our business. If you're a technical expert in how do you evaluate business, evaluate those numbers against any other business you've ever seen and then make your decision. But yes, I'm wildly enthusiastic. I think we're wildly enthusiastic. And thank you for those of you who stayed with us to enjoy these numbers, especially Palantirians who work day and night to deliver these kind of numbers.
Ana Soro: Thank you, Alex. We'll now turn to questions from our shareholders before opening up the call. We received a few questions asking what do you see as Palantir's unique differentiator that others may not understand?
Shyam Sankar: Well, Alex mentioned a bit of this here. It's become fashionable actually for lots of companies to start hiring FDEs. The Financial Times had an article about how it's the most popular new job title. But what you see is that they don't really understand it. It's just mimetic. And if you -- everything Alex, you said, like we build software that works, that not software that ought to work. We build software for the world as it exists, not a world that never was. And this ability to find what's true, that comes from the FDE. Our measure of success is not did we sell the software, it's did we solve the problem. And we have built an entire software stack over 2 decades, downstream of creating value for our customers. That led to the ontology a decade ago, more than a decade ago, which is a fundamental prerequisite to getting value out of LLMs in the enterprise. In this past year, it led to AI Hivemind and AI FDE.
Alexander Karp: The other thing, which like is implicit in that is the way we work puts us -- forces us to go up the chain of complexity every day. So we're taking on the most painful, most integral, most valuable parts of the stack in every enterprise. And it's precisely because like that's the way we actually lever our ability to deploy and orchestrate FDEs. That's the way we make our products stronger. And quite frankly, that's the way we produce these numbers because the closer you are to the front line of the very complex problem that a black box was not meant to solve, cannot solve. And at this point, everyone knows a joke to believe it could solve, that's where you -- and by the way, it's the safest position for us because this company, we will always believe that we are outsiders. We need to be in the place where the most valuable problem is being solved because that's the way we end up staying, solving the problem tomorrow and the way we get paid.
Ana Soro: Thank you both. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. [Operator Instructions].
Daniel Ives: Look, obviously, another monster quarter for you guys, congrats. So my question for you is for Alex and team. What -- can you just walk through just the accelerated sales cycles that you're seeing from so many companies that have gone to the boot camps? Like what surprised you from when they come to you at that first sort of contact to now actually launching deals. I mean, maybe you could talk about that just in terms of everything you're seeing anecdotally.
Ryan Taylor: Thanks, Dan. So I think we look at U.S. commercial. We closed $1.3 billion in TCV at 6x on a dollar-weighted duration basis from what it was a year ago. And of those deals worth 83 were worth of $1 million or more 40 were $5 million or more, the 21 deals were $10 million or more. I've been involved in a lot of those directly. I'm feeling exactly what you're asking on the ground from customers. And what's happening now is from the C-suite across the company, customers are coming to us looking to not just say, let's do a use case. The customers who are having the most impact are coming to us saying, how do we deploy this across our entire organization, how do we reorganize our entire organization around Palantir and AIP. And that's what's happening on the ground. And we're singularly focused on delivering the value to the customers, and that's our go-to-market. How do we get the product to them and deliver...
Alexander Karp: Where Ryan is like really very much on the front line here is there's both how many customers approach you. I think where we're seeing the biggest shift is the customers who've approached us very quickly want to move to how would I change my enterprise to express it in a way that's most valuable according to my terms in your product? And then one -- and literally want a reorg, a short-hand version that we often use is you used to have to take a company private to change the unit economics of it. Basically, just like we're providing venture results, high-end venture results to normal investors in the last couple of years, what we're doing actually in enterprise is, is providing a private equity like transformation in the public markets, in the public space under the current leadership. And that's essentially what our best -- and by the way, the other thing Ryan would tell you about is our newer clients have much higher expectations of us. Like they're like, essentially, I want to transform my business. I want to do it in months. I want to do it in the public eye, while being in the public market, mostly not exclusively. And I want you to not only do the product side but also tell us how would you actually implement AI, foundry, ontology, FDE model and our tribal knowledge to do that. And it's a completely different game. We used to have to beg and plead to be like -- when we first started talking, we were begging and pleading to be at the margin of a problem that could affect a subset of the business. By the way, Shyam, it's like, unfortunately, can only tell you 1% what he's involved in. But this is like exactly the same in the U.S. government around the world. It's like the things that we're sitting on and working on are like crazy, crazy and important and are not downstream of the problem. They are the problem, and we're reshaping them.
Ana Soro: Thank you both. Our next question from Mariana with Bank of America.
Mariana Perez Mora: I'm going to do, as usual, a couple of questions, one on commercial, one on defense or government. On commercial, I'd like to follow up to Dan's question. And let's see if you can discuss what changed from a behavioral perspective, from a customer perspective to see this accelerated appetite to incorporate Palantir to not only accelerating how many customers you have, but also the existing customers go to -- go up the value chain. And what changed internally as well? We recently saw in a visit the like AI agents or AI FDE is, like how are you incorporating tech internally to be able to accelerate and catch up with that demand? And on the government side, U.S. government up 50% plus is really impressive. And how do you think about opportunities like Golden Dome going forward adding up to this?
Alexander Karp: Well, you guys want to answer these questions? I think that there's an external one, which is like what does it feel like? That's clearly you. The internal one is a really subtle question. And I don't know anyone should jump in there? And then obviously, you should have Shyam opine on.
Shyam Sankar: Yes. Well, do you want to start with commercial or...
Ryan Taylor: Sure. Yes. I think on the external, I think it's like going deeper and deeper and more and more like tangible results with customers where they're -- there's a network effect in coming, like customer sharing impact that we're having and direct impact we're having with customers. Customers are seeing as we -- it's a continuation of what we've been doing, but going deeper and deeper with the customers on that impact. And I think that what we're seeing is more and more are now coming to us saying -- and the ones that are most impactful are coming to us saying, let's do more.
Alexander Karp: Ryan is our best at being a wonderful -- I'll just give a vulgar version here. Our clients realize the choice is suck basically. And they've tried a lot of stuff. It hasn't worked. And then we're in so many verticals. We're -- let's just say, we're in vertical 252 and we dominate for one customer. People see that. And then they're like, "Oh, well, I'll try this with some, I don't know, knock off half fake thing. It's just like -- and then a lot of people really still don't understand that are still trying to do this long migration where LLMs are going to perform as if they're LLMs and ontology. And as if they are LLMs were not a commodity. And then -- but then in the marketplace, they see the final result of someone else using ontology, foundry, FDE. And now it's like, wait a minute, I'm paying hundreds of millions of dollars in getting nothing. And the person down the road, I kind of looked down on is way ahead of me and their unit economics are transforming overnight. And that just shifts the whole conversation because then we're like, okay, well, if you want it to work, you can have to do these 5 things. And these things are like you're going to have to talk to Ryan and they're going to have to -- I don't know, occasionally meet with me, and you're going to have to actually allow us to come in with engineers. And you're going to -- we're going to have to actually work on the problems that are valuable for your business and also look at the costs that are dragging you down. By the way, the cost for most businesses is not just the actual money they're wasting. That wasted money creates an ecosystem of waste. They're talking to all these vendors all the time about all these things will never work instead of solving the problem. And so like -- and so getting the pathogens out of their business is a real issue, and now they're really, really interested in this. And so -- and then on the internal front, I would say it's just we have to double down. The most important thing for us internally is with all this success, we do not want to give up the unique attributes of Palantir and somehow purchase fake ways for us that are artificial for us. And so making sure we are very, very close to the problem and making sure everyone here, like if you heard our internal dialogue, it's much more like who's on the factory floor here. What are we doing internally? How do we make sure our products are better and better? How do we make sure, say, Shyam is a savant at going around and figuring out what the underlying tech issue is, how are we making sure we have the best product team and the very, very exact right fit for every single deployment across our deployments that we care about, especially mission deployments, which we highly, highly overvalue in terms of our time and energy. And like how do you make sure Palantir stays as tribal and cultus and unique as it was 20 years ago? How do we double and triple down on that? And how do we recruit the right people. And then internally, we have, look, we power ICE, we power efforts to defend America and Ukraine and with allies. We're on the front line of all adversaries, including vis-a-vis China. And we support -- we're at ICE and we're -- we've supported Israel. Okay. These are very controversies. I don't know why this is all controversial, but many people find that controversial. Okay? So how do you align people to focus on these things in a way that is actually beneficial for us and our clients. These are really hard and tricky issues that we spend a lot of time. I would say, as an overarching thing, because what we found is the more we focus on our internal dynamics, the better our numbers are. That's why we have less salespeople, and we have 77% growth in 75% of our market, 121% growth in U.S. comp. Please tell that to some of your friends. I don't even understand how they can look at these numbers and not drop the key out of their [ Immortal Six ] and just like say, I mean, they're like they're fantastic numbers but it's like internal focus.
Shyam Sankar: I'll make the mistake of trying to follow Alex there and just say on the internal side with AIFDE, that's why we actually originally built it. Our headcount has grown roughly 10%, but revenue grew 63%. How are we doing that? We've made our FDEs wildly more productive. And I mean, so much so that we decided to give it to our customers. And we've started to make our customers more productive. When you have a note like the Army Vantage note, where the Army is consolidating into the Army data platform, you now have an army, literal army of green suiters who need to become proficient developers in the software. And you have a generation of green suiters whose first interaction with the software is going to be with AI FDE. They're going to be super heroes on day 1. I think that it's accelerating adoption. It's accelerating understanding like the depth of adoption, not just are you using it, but how much of it are you really using? How much of it can you understand? And then quickly on your comment on the U.S. government business, like, yes, the number of opportunities out there are great. I can't comment on all the opportunities you mentioned there, but whether it's NGC2, the continued growth of, Maven, I mean we have, of course, America is involved with 3 conflicts right now in the world from Europe, the Middle East and in our own hemisphere right now. And things are getting a little spicy. By the way, let me say something slightly political, and I'm not saying other people agree with this. But when people are attacking our soldiers for stopping fentanyl from coming to this country, I want people to remember, if fentanyl was killing 60,000 Yale grads instead of 60,000 working class people, we'd be dropping a nuclear bomb on whoever was sending it for South America. So it's slightly -- like we -- in this -- at Palantir, we are on the side of the American -- average American who sometimes gets screwed because all the empathy goes to elite people and none of it goes to the people who are actually dying on our streets. And that's why it's like when you have an open border, it means that the average poor American earns less. I know my fellow progressives believe having an open border is going to make things, but that's because they're actually repping elite people instead of the working class. And the same thing in South America, is like to believe our constitution does not give us the right to stop 60,000 deaths a year of working class men and women is insane. And this company -- this country is right to stop that. And I am very proud. I don't know all the efforts we're involved in, but to the extent we're involved in these efforts, I and most Palantirians are very proud of this.
Ana Soro: Thank you. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you'd like to say before we end the call?
Alexander Karp: We're rocking along. Please turn on the conventional television and see how unhappy those that didn't invest in us are, enjoy get some popcorn, they're crying. We are every day making this company better, and we're doing it for this nation, for allied countries and also for -- and I never really like the term retail investors. How about same people who put up their own money and fight for us -- and by the way, you are fighting for the right side of what should work in this country, meritocracy, lethal technology vis-a-vis adversaries, products that spread GDP to working-class women, men and women by making their value creation higher and by the way, your bank account. And thank you for that.
Ana Soro: Thank you. That concludes Q&A for today's call.

Supported outcomes (where management explicitly addressed historical comparisons and numbers confirm)
- Management: "closed our highest TCV quarter ever at $2.8 billion" — Confirmed. Prior comparable quarter listed TCV $1.1B; current $2.8B is a clear record and supports management's claim of a highest-ever TCV quarter.
- Management: "highest ever reported adjusted operating margin of 51%" and "exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by 500 basis points" — Confirmed. Prior adjusted operating margin was 38% (2024‑Q3); current 51% is a clear, material improvement in margin.
- Management: "Third quarter GAAP net income $476 million" and improved GAAP margins — Confirmed against prior GAAP net income $144 million (2024‑Q3); current net income and margin (40% net margin, 33% operating margin) show large bottom-line improvement.
- Management: "generated $508 million in cash from operations and $540 million in adjusted free cash flow" and "generated $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow for the first time TTM" — Confirmed in the quarter-over-quarter comparison: cash from ops and adjusted FCF this quarter exceed prior Q3 figures ($420M and $435M respectively), and the TTM adjusted FCF milestone aligns with the step-up in quarterly free cash flow.
- Management: "combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 114% ... our ninth consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 score" — Confirmed. Rule of 40 moved from 68 (2024‑Q3) to 114% (2025‑Q3), validating the management statement about substantial acceleration and sustained expansion.

Summary emphasis on bottom-line improvements
- Net income and margins: GAAP net income rose from $144M to $476M and GAAP operating margin from 16% to 33%; adjusted operating margin rose from 38% to 51% — clear and large bottom-line improvements.
- EPS and cash flow: Adjusted EPS roughly doubled (from $0.10 to $0.21) and operating cash flow and adjusted FCF increased materially — confirming stronger profitability and cash conversion versus the comparable prior quarter.
- Bookings/backlog: Record TCV ($2.8B) and much larger remaining deal value ($8.6B) support forward revenue and continued bottom-line strength.

Peers note:
English

- Fact 1 — Overall revenue growth rate (PLTR: 63% YoY, 18% QoQ): PLTR is highlighting very large double‑digit growth (63% YoY), which is well above the modest single‑digit and low‑double‑digit YoY growth called out by peers in the sample (e.g., IQV +5.3% in 2025‑Q2; SNPS +13% in 2024‑Q3). PLTR’s narrative emphasizes scale and acceleration versus peers’ more muted growth messaging (IQV 5.3% (IQV, 2025‑Q2); SNPS 13% (SNPS, 2024‑Q3)).

- Fact 2 — U.S. revenue mix and growth (PLTR: U.S. = 3/4 of business; U.S. +77% YoY, +20% QoQ): The company stresses U.S. concentration and outsized U.S. growth; the comparable set contains no similarly explicit U.S. mix/growth statements in these historical excerpts, so PLTR’s emphasis on geography and very high U.S. growth is a distinctive call‑out (no close comparable metric in the sample).

- Fact 3 — Rule of 40 score (PLTR: 114%, +4pts YoY, +20pts QoQ): PLTR frames an extremely high Rule of 40 (triple‑digit) as a key performance story. Peers mention meeting or achieving Rule‑of‑40 targets more generically (e.g., IBM “Achieved”), but do not report anywhere near PLTR’s numeric level in the provided excerpts, so PLTR is positioning growth+profitability as a standout (IBM “Achieved” (IBM, 2024‑Q4)).

- Fact 4 — U.S. commercial revenue growth (PLTR: U.S. commercial +121% YoY, +29% QoQ): PLTR emphasizes hyper‑growth in a commercial subsegment; the comparable snippets show far lower commercial growth figures or lack subsegment breakout, making PLTR’s rate and segmentation narrative materially more aggressive (no close comparable commercial‑subsegment rate in the sample).

- Fact 6 — Total contract value (TCV) for the quarter (PLTR: $2.8B highest ever): PLTR emphasizes record bookings scale and large YoY increase. Comparable call excerpts discuss RPO/TCV in different magnitudes (e.g., EME RPO $12.6B; DDOG RPO $2.79B), but none combine “record quarter” messaging at PLTR’s exact scale in these excerpts — PLTR stresses booking strength as a growth driver (EME RPO $12.6B (EME, 2025‑Q3); DDOG RPO $2.79B (DDOG, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 8 — U.S. commercial share and TCV (PLTR: U.S. commercial = 34% of revenue; closed $1.3B TCV; >6x YoY growth on dollar‑weighted duration): PLTR calls out both mix and massive dollar‑weighted TCV growth, a level of granularity and magnitude not present in the peer snippets (no direct comparable for dollar‑weighted duration growth in the sample).

- Fact 11 — Q4 2025 revenue guidance (PLTR: $1.329B, +13% QoQ, +61% YoY): PLTR provides a high single‑quarter revenue guide that implies very strong YoY growth; peers’ Q4 guides in the sample are materially different in size and growth assumption (e.g., DDOG $912–916M guidance for Q4 implying lower absolute revenue), so PLTR’s guide is both numerically larger and pitched as continuation of rapid growth (DDOG $912–916M (DDOG, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 12 — Full year 2025 revenue guidance midpoint (PLTR: midpoint $4.398B, +53% YoY): PLTR is raising a high‑growth full‑year target; peer full‑year ranges in the excerpts vary but often sit in lower absolute or lower growth bands (AKAM $4.135–4.205B; PAYC $2.015–2.035B), so PLTR emphasizes higher growth and a tight range around a larger midpoint (AKAM $4.135–4.205B (AKAM, 2025‑Q2); PAYC $2.015–2.035B (PAYC, 2024‑Q4)).

- Fact 13 — Full year 2025 U.S. commercial revenue guidance (PLTR: >$1.433B, ≥104% YoY): PLTR singles out a segment guide with 100%+ growth, which is substantially more aggressive than the segment‑level guidance shown in the peer excerpts (no comparable segment guide at this magnitude in the sample).

- Fact 16 — Adjusted operating margin (PLTR: 51%, highest ever; +500 bps vs guidance high end): PLTR reports an exceptionally high adjusted operating margin (51%) and frames it as exceeding prior guidance materially. Peer adjusted operating margins in the sample are markedly lower (examples: TEL 19.3%; FISV 37.8%; BDX 23.6%), so PLTR is stressing a much stronger profitability profile than typical peer outcomes in these excerpts (TEL 19.3% (TEL, 2024‑Q3); FISV 37.8% (FISV, 2025‑Q1); BDX 23.6% (BDX, 2025‑Q1)).

- Fact 18 — Q3 2025 total revenue (PLTR: $1.181B): PLTR’s reported Q3 absolute revenue is higher than several peers’ Q3 figures in the sample and paired with very strong YoY growth; peers show a range of Q3 totals (e.g., AKAM $1.055B; HOOD “nearly $1.3B”), so PLTR positions itself among higher‑growth, mid‑to‑large revenue SaaS/tech peers (AKAM $1.055B (AKAM, 2025‑Q3); HOOD nearly $1.3B (HOOD, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 20 — TCV bookings growth (PLTR: $2.8B, +151% YoY; nearly $0.5B above prior high): PLTR emphasizes both scale and substantial YoY expansion in bookings; peers cite RPO/TCV growth but generally at different magnitudes — PLTR’s quarter is positioned as an outlier in growth strength (EME +$2.8B RPO YoY increase example (EME, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 21 — Customer count (PLTR: 911 customers, +45% YoY, +7% QoQ): PLTR emphasizes rapid customer addition; peer excerpts reference NDR or customer stability (e.g., DDOG NDR ~120%) but not identical customer count growth, so PLTR focuses on expanding customer base as a structural driver (DDOG NDR 120% (DDOG, 2025‑Q3); no direct customer‑count comparison in sample).

- Fact 22 — Top 20 customers’ average revenue (PLTR: $83M per customer TTM, +38% YoY): PLTR highlights increasing monetization per large customer; peers’ excerpts don’t show top‑20 average revenue metrics in the sample, so this is a more customer‑concentration/motion‑focused disclosure unique in tone (no direct comparable metric in the sample).

- Fact 23 — Commercial revenue (PLTR: $548M, +73% YoY, +22% QoQ): PLTR’s commercial segment is large and fast‑growing; peer commercial figures in the sample are lower or lack similar growth rates (CHTR +0.8% commercial growth example), so PLTR stresses much stronger commercial momentum (CHTR 0.8% (CHTR, 2025‑Q2)).

- Fact 24 — Commercial TCV (PLTR: $1.4B, +132% YoY, +32% QoQ): PLTR highlights commercial bookings strength and sequential acceleration; peers’ booking/RPO notes exist but not at comparable commercial TCV scale in the excerpts (DDOG RPO $2.79B overall, not segmented) (DDOG RPO $2.79B (DDOG, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 26 — U.S. commercial TCV over last 12 months (PLTR: $3.8B, +217% vs prior 12 months): PLTR emphasizes dramatic multi‑period expansion; peers do report RPO growth but not this specific dollar‑level and multiyear multiple in the sample (EME +$2.8B YoY RPO cited; DDOG RPO +53% YoY), so PLTR’s narrative is more aggressive on multi‑period commercial traction (EME RPO $12.6B (EME, 2025‑Q3); DDOG RPO $2.79B (DDOG, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 29 — International commercial revenue (PLTR: $152M, +10% YoY, +5% QoQ): PLTR shows modest international commercial growth while overall growth is much higher — peers sometimes show international growth (DXCM international $357.4M, +22%) but PLTR’s message contrasts a dominant U.S. story with smaller international gains (DXCM $357.4M international (DXCM, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 31 — Future Q4 revenue from strategic commercial contracts (PLTR: $2–4M vs $9.6M in Q4 2024): PLTR calls out a negligible near‑term contribution from specific strategic contracts; peers rarely call out such a precise small contribution in the sample, so PLTR is being more granular and conservative on a narrow revenue component (no close comparable in sample).

- Fact 32 — 2025 revenue share from strategic contracts (PLTR: <0.5% of full year): PLTR quantifies immateriality explicitly; peers’ excerpts do not provide similarly granular fractional guidance on a specific contract class, making PLTR’s disclosure unusually precise and negligible‑focused (no close comparable in sample).

- Fact 33 — Government revenue (PLTR: $633M, +55% YoY, +14% QoQ): PLTR’s government segment is large and fast‑growing; peer excerpts include government/other segments sparingly — PLTR emphasizes government as a major growth engine while peers tend to present more balanced or smaller segment swings (no direct government segment comparable in sample).

- Fact 35 — International government revenue (PLTR: $147M, +66% YoY, +16% QoQ): PLTR records strong international government growth; peers in sample show international government figures rarely, so PLTR’s international government acceleration is a highlighted difference (no direct comparable in sample).

- Fact 36 — Net dollar retention (PLTR: 134%, +600 bps QoQ): PLTR reports very high and accelerating NDR (134%), above the DDOG example in the sample (~120%), and presents NDR as a rapid improving lever — PLTR frames stronger expansion from existing customers than many peers (DDOG NDR ~120% (DDOG, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 37 — Total remaining deal value and RPO (PLTR: $8.6B TRDV +91% YoY, +21% QoQ; RPO $2.6B +66% YoY, +8% QoQ): PLTR emphasizes large backlog growth; peers report RPOs but at varying absolute levels (EME RPO $12.6B; DDOG RPO $2.79B), so PLTR is positioning a large and rapidly growing backlog though magnitudes differ across companies (EME RPO $12.6B (EME, 2025‑Q3); DDOG RPO $2.79B (DDOG, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 38 — Adjusted gross margin (PLTR: 84%): PLTR reports an unusually high adjusted gross margin (84%); peers’ adjusted gross margins in the sample are substantially lower (ZTS 71.6%; ZBH 72.6%; BDX 54.3%), so PLTR is distinguishing itself on gross profitability (ZTS 71.6% (ZTS, 2025‑Q3); ZBH 72.6% (ZBH, 2025‑Q3); BDX 54.3% (BDX, 2024‑Q3)).

- Fact 41 — GAAP operating and net income (PLTR: GAAP op income $393M = 33% margin; GAAP net income $476M = 40% margin): PLTR reports robust GAAP profitability and margins in the 30–40% range; peer GAAP net/op income examples in the sample vary widely and are generally smaller in margin emphasis, so PLTR stresses sustained GAAP profitability as a differentiator (CPRT GAAP net income $407M (CPRT, 2025‑Q3); ISRG Q3 GAAP net income $704M (ISRG, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 42 — Earnings per share (PLTR: GAAP EPS $0.18; adjusted EPS $0.21): PLTR reports modest per‑share numbers but with strong margins; peer EPS figures in the sample are often higher in dollars but tied to different share counts and business models (examples: ON $0.93; ADBE $3.49), so direct dollar comparisons are of limited use — PLTR frames EPS in context of high margins and strong cash generation (ON $0.93 (ON, 2024‑Q3); ADBE $3.49 (ADBE, 2024‑Q2)).

- Fact 43 — Rule of 40 trajectory (PLTR: 114%, nine consecutive quarters of expansion): PLTR emphasizes a sustained improving trajectory to a very high Rule of 40. Peers refer to achieving Rule of 40 targets more generically; PLTR’s combination of long‑run expansion plus a triple‑digit score is presented as exceptional (IBM “Achieved” (IBM, 2024‑Q4)).

- Fact 44 — Full‑year 2025 Rule of 40 guidance (PLTR: 102%): PLTR gives a full‑year Rule‑of‑40 target over 100%, whereas peers typically give operating margin or revenue guides separately (NOW operating margin expectations, SNPS non‑GAAP margin guidance examples). PLTR integrates growth+profit guidance into a high composite metric (NOW expected operating margin 30.5% example (NOW, 2025‑Q1); SNPS non‑GAAP margin 40% at midpoint example (SNPS, 2025‑Q1)).

- Fact 45 — Operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow for Q3 (PLTR: $508M ops cash; $540M adj FCF; margins 43% and 46%): PLTR reports very large cash generation and unusually high cash margins; peers’ adj FCF examples in the sample are smaller in absolute or margin terms (OTIS adj FCF $381M example), so PLTR touts unusually strong cash conversion (OTIS $381M adj FCF (OTIS, 2024‑Q3)).

- Fact 47 — Q4 2025 adjusted operating income guidance (PLTR: $695–699M): PLTR guides to high quarterly adjusted operating income. Peers’ operating income guidance ranges in the sample are lower or structured differently (DVA $1.825–1.975B full‑year adjusted op income historical), so PLTR’s near‑term profitability guide is presented at a high absolute quarterly level (DVA adjusted op income guidance examples (DVA, 2024‑Q4)).

- Fact 48 — Full year 2025 revenue guidance range (PLTR: $4.396–4.400B): PLTR provides a tight full‑year range at a high midpoint; peers’ full‑year ranges vary (AKAM $4.135–4.205B; FTNT $6.65–6.85B), so PLTR is both tightening and raising its range around elevated growth assumptions (AKAM $4.135–4.205B (AKAM, 2025‑Q2); FTNT $6.65–6.85B (FTNT, 2024‑Q4)).

- Fact 49 — Full year 2025 adjusted operating income guidance (PLTR: $2.151–2.155B): PLTR gives a large full‑year adjusted op income guide; comparable adjusted op income guidance examples are present in the sample but often at different absolute scales — PLTR stresses very high profitability conversion (DVA $2.01B–2.16B adjusted op income example (DVA, 2024‑Q4)).

- Fact 50 — Full year 2025 adjusted free cash flow guidance (PLTR: $1.9–2.1B): PLTR’s FCF guide is sizable and presented as raised; peers’ FCF guidance in the sample spans a wide range (F $2B–3B; ZBH $1B–1.2B), so PLTR positions itself with strong cash generation relative to many peers (F $2B–3B (F, 2025‑Q3); ZBH $1B–1.2B (ZBH, 2025‑Q3)).

- Fact 51 — Expectation of GAAP profitability (PLTR: expect GAAP operating & net income each quarter): PLTR explicitly commits to quarterly GAAP profitability; peer commentary in the sample sometimes gives GAAP expectations but not always with such a firm per‑quarter commitment — PLTR is more categorical about sustained GAAP profitability (examples of GAAP profitability expectations are less categorical in the sample; ALGN GAAP operating margin expectation 13–14% cited as a broader range (ALGN, 2025‑Q2)).

Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)

- 事實 1 — 總營收成長率 (PLTR：年增 63%，季增 18%)：PLTR 強調非常高的兩位數成長（年增 63%），遠高於樣本中同業較為溫和的個位數或低兩位數成長（例如 IQV 2025‑Q2 年增 5.3%；SNPS 2024‑Q3 年增 13%）。PLTR 的論述強調規模與加速，而同業的成長表述較為低調（IQV 5.3% (IQV, 2025‑Q2); SNPS 13% (SNPS, 2024‑Q3)）。

- 事實 2 — 美國營收組合與成長 (PLTR：美國占 3/4；美國年增 77%，季增 20%)：公司強調美國營收占比及美國地區超高成長；在提供的同業摘錄中沒有類似的美國組合/成長表述，因此 PLTR 對地理區域與極高美國成長的強調具有差異（樣本中無直接可比指標）。

- 事實 3 — Rule of 40 分數 (PLTR：114%，年增 +4 點，季增 +20 點)：PLTR 將極高的 Rule of 40（超過 100%）作為關鍵表現故事。樣本中同業提到達成 Rule of 40 較為通用（例如 IBM 表示 “Achieved”），但並未呈現接近 PLTR 數值的報告，PLTR 將成長與獲利合併為突出項目 (IBM “Achieved” (IBM, 2024‑Q4))。

- 事實 4 — 美國商業營收成長 (PLTR：美國商業年增 121%，季增 29%)：PLTR 強調商業子業務的超高速成長；樣本中同業沒有呈現相似子分段的高成長數據，PLTR 的速度與分段敘事更為激進（樣本中無直接可比商業子分段成長率）。

- 事實 6 — 季度總合約價值 TCV (PLTR：$2.8B，創紀錄)：PLTR 強調訂單規模創新高及顯著年增。可比的摘錄談及 RPO/TCV 在不同規模（例如 EME RPO $12.6B；DDOG RPO $2.79B），但樣本中無呈現 PLTR 該季度同等規模的「創紀錄」敘事 — PLTR 將訂單強度視為成長動力 (EME RPO $12.6B (EME, 2025‑Q3); DDOG RPO $2.79B (DDOG, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 8 — 美國商業在總營收及 TCV 的占比 (PLTR：美國商業占 34%；關閉 $1.3B TCV；按金額加權期間增長 >6x)：PLTR 同時指出組合與巨幅 TCV 成長，這種金額加權期間成長的細節及幅度在樣本中無直接對照（樣本中無此類金額加權期間成長的直接可比指標）。

- 事實 11 — 2025 年第 4 季營收指引 (PLTR：$1.329B，季增 13%，年增 61%)：PLTR 提供一個高水準的單季營收指引，暗示續行強勁年增；樣本中的 Q4 指引絕對值與成長假設通常較低（例如 DDOG 指引 $912–916M），因此 PLTR 的指引在數值與成長率上都更為激進 (DDOG $912–916M (DDOG, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 12 — 2025 全年營收指引中點 (PLTR：中點 $4.398B，年增 53%)：PLTR 上調並給出高成長全年目標；樣本中的全年區間常為較低絕對值或較低成長（AKAM $4.135–4.205B；PAYC $2.015–2.035B），因此 PLTR 強調更高成長且在較大中點周圍維持緊密區間 (AKAM $4.135–4.205B (AKAM, 2025‑Q2); PAYC $2.015–2.035B (PAYC, 2024‑Q4))。

- 事實 13 — 2025 全年美國商業營收指引 (PLTR：> $1.433B，至少 +104% YoY)：PLTR 對一段業務提出 100% 以上的成長指引，該幅度在樣本中無類似的分段指引，故其攻勢更為積極（樣本中無此等級的分段指引）。

- 事實 16 — 經調整營運利潤率 (PLTR：51%，歷史新高；比先前指引高端超出 500 基點)：PLTR 報告非常高的經調整營運利潤率並強調超出指引；樣本中同業的經調整營運利潤率遠低（TEL 19.3%；FISV 37.8%；BDX 23.6%），PLTR 在獲利力道上明顯強於同業範例 (TEL 19.3% (TEL, 2024‑Q3); FISV 37.8% (FISV, 2025‑Q1); BDX 23.6% (BDX, 2025‑Q1))。

- 事實 18 — 2025 年第 3 季總營收 (PLTR：$1.181B)：PLTR 的 Q3 營收絕對值與高年增率，與樣本中一些同業 Q3 數字相比屬於較高區間；同業呈現的 Q3 絕對數值範圍如 AKAM $1.055B、HOOD 近 $1.3B，PLTR 被定位為高成長、較大型的 SaaS/科技公司之一 (AKAM $1.055B (AKAM, 2025‑Q3); HOOD nearly $1.3B (HOOD, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 20 — TCV 訂單成長 (PLTR：$2.8B，年增 151%，較先前高點高出近 $0.5B)：PLTR 強調規模和顯著年增；雖有同業報告 RPO/TCV，但樣本中的數值或分布不同，PLTR 將該季度定位為明顯的成長強勁者 (EME 年增 RPO $2.8B 的例子 (EME, 2025‑Q3)).

- 事實 21 — 客戶數 (PLTR：911 客戶，年增 45%，季增 7%)：PLTR 強調快速新增客戶；樣本中同業多談 NDR 或客戶穩定性（如 DDOG NDR ~120%），但沒有相同的客戶數成長表述，PLTR 把客戶基數擴張視為結構性驅動 (DDOG NDR 120% (DDOG, 2025‑Q3); 樣本無直接客戶數可比)。

- 事實 22 — 前 20 大客戶平均營收 (PLTR：TTM 每客戶 $83M，年增 38%)：PLTR 強調大客戶的貨幣化提升；樣本中未提供前 20 客戶平均營收指標，故此為 PLTR 更專注的客戶集中/貨幣化敘事（樣本無直接可比）。

- 事實 23 — 商業營收 (PLTR：$548M，年增 73%，季增 22%)：PLTR 的商業部門規模大且成長快速；樣本中某些公司的商業成長較低（CHTR 商業年增 0.8%），PLTR 強調顯著的商業動能 (CHTR 0.8% (CHTR, 2025‑Q2))。

- 事實 24 — 商業 TCV (PLTR：$1.4B，年增 132%，季增 32%)：PLTR 強調商業訂單的強勁與加速；樣本中有 RPO/TCV 的討論但未見商業段如此規模與成長，PLTR 的商業訂單敘事更具攻勢 (DDOG RPO $2.79B 為整體指標，非分段) (DDOG, 2025‑Q3)。

- 事實 26 — 過去 12 個月美國商業 TCV (PLTR：$3.8B，較前 12 個月 +217%)：PLTR 強調多期（12 個月）極大增長；雖有同業報告 RPO 增長，但樣本中無相同金額與倍數的多期比較，PLTR 的多期商業牽引面向更為攻擊性 (EME RPO $12.6B (EME, 2025‑Q3); DDOG RPO $2.79B (DDOG, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 29 — 國際商業營收 (PLTR：$152M，年增 10%，季增 5%)：PLTR 顯示國際商業成長較為溫和，與其整體高成長形成對比；樣本中有國際營收的案例（DXCM 國際 $357.4M，年增 22%），但 PLTR 更著重美國為主且國際次之的敘事 (DXCM $357.4M 國際營收 (DXCM, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 31 — Q4 從策略商業合約預期營收 (PLTR：$2–4M，而 2024Q4 為 $9.6M)：PLTR 明確指出特定策略合約在短期內貢獻極小；樣本中少見公司對此類狹義收入項目給出如此精確且微小的預期，PLTR 的披露更為謹慎且細緻（樣本無直接可比）。

- 事實 32 — 2025 年來自策略合約的營收占比 (PLTR：<0.5% 全年)：PLTR 明確量化其不重要性；樣本中無同等細緻的百分比說明，這類「極小比重」的量化在樣本中不常見（樣本無直接可比）。

- 事實 33 — 政府營收 (PLTR：$633M，年增 55%，季增 14%)：PLTR 的政府部門規模大且增速顯著；樣本中關於政府分部的揭露較少，PLTR 將政府視為主要成長動力的一部分（樣本中無直接政府細分可比）。

- 事實 35 — 國際政府營收 (PLTR：$147M，年增 66%，季增 16%)：PLTR 報告國際政府營收快速成長；樣本中較少提供國際政府的具體數字，PLTR 特別強調國際政府加速（樣本無直接可比）。

- 事實 36 — 淨收入留存率 NDR (PLTR：134%，季增 +600 bps)：PLTR 報告非常高且加速的 NDR（134%），超過樣本中 DDOG 約 120% 的例子，PLTR 把現有客戶擴張視為顯著成長槓桿 (DDOG NDR ~120% (DDOG, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 37 — 總剩餘交易價值與 RPO (PLTR：TRDV $8.6B，年增 91%，季增 21%；RPO $2.6B，年增 66%，季增 8%)：PLTR 強調龐大且快速成長的 backlog；同業有 RPO 報告但絕對數字與 PLTR 不同（EME RPO $12.6B；DDOG RPO $2.79B），PLTR 將 backlog 視為未來收入的強力指標 (EME RPO $12.6B (EME, 2025‑Q3); DDOG RPO $2.79B (DDOG, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 38 — 經調整毛利率 (PLTR：84%)：PLTR 報告極高的經調整毛利率 84%；樣本中同業毛利率多在 50–73% 範圍（ZTS 71.6%；ZBH 72.6%；BDX 54.3%），PLTR 在毛利率上自我定位為顯著優於多數同業 (ZTS 71.6% (ZTS, 2025‑Q3); ZBH 72.6% (ZBH, 2025‑Q3); BDX 54.3% (BDX, 2024‑Q3))。

- 事實 41 — GAAP 營業與淨利 (PLTR：GAAP 營業利益 $393M = 33% margin；GAAP 淨利 $476M = 40% margin)：PLTR 報告強勁的 GAAP 獲利及高利潤率；樣本中的 GAAP 淨利範例差異很大且通常未強調如此高的百分比利潤，PLTR 將持續 GAAP 獲利作為差異化要點 (CPRT GAAP 淨利 $407M (CPRT, 2025‑Q3); ISRG Q3 GAAP 淨利 $704M (ISRG, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 42 — 每股盈餘 (PLTR：GAAP EPS $0.18；調整後 EPS $0.21)：PLTR 報告每股金額不大，但在高利潤與現金生成背景下呈現；樣本中其他公司 EPS 金額因股本及商業模式差異而較高（如 ON $0.93；ADBE $3.49），直接比較有限，但 PLTR 將 EPS 與高利潤/現金流一併展示 (ON $0.93 (ON, 2024‑Q3); ADBE $3.49 (ADBE, 2024‑Q2))。

- 事實 43 — Rule of 40 軌跡 (PLTR：114%，連續九季擴張)：PLTR 強調持續擴張到非常高的 Rule of 40。雖有同業宣稱達標（IBM “Achieved”），但 PLTR 報告的長期上升趨勢與三位數分數在樣本中顯得突出 (IBM “Achieved” (IBM, 2024‑Q4))。

- 事實 44 — 2025 全年 Rule of 40 指引 (PLTR：102%)：PLTR 給出全年超過 100% 的 Rule of 40 目標；同業通常分別給出營收或營利率指引，少有以如此高的合成指標作為全年目標（NOW 營業利潤預期 30.5% 例子；SNPS 非 GAAP 營利率 40% 例子），PLTR 將成長與獲利合併為一個高指標 (NOW 30.5% (NOW, 2025‑Q1); SNPS 40% non‑GAAP midpoint (SNPS, 2025‑Q1))。

- 事實 45 — 第 3 季營運現金與調整後自由現金流 (PLTR：營運現金 $508M；調整後 FCF $540M；邊際 43% 與 46%)：PLTR 報告極大現金生成與高現金邊際；樣本中調整後 FCF 的例子較小（OTIS $381M），PLTR 將現金轉換率視為一項顯著優勢 (OTIS $381M adj FCF (OTIS, 2024‑Q3))。

- 事實 47 — 2025 Q4 經調整營業利益指引 (PLTR：$695–699M)：PLTR 指引高額的單季經調整營業利益。樣本中某些公司的營業利益指引在結構或絕對值上不同，PLTR 的短期獲利指引被表述為高絕對值 (DVA 調整後營業利益指引範例 (DVA, 2024‑Q4))。

- 事實 48 — 2025 全年營收指引區間 (PLTR：$4.396–4.400B)：PLTR 提供緊湊且高中的全年區間；樣本中全年區間有不同層級（AKAM $4.135–4.205B；FTNT $6.65–6.85B），PLTR 的做法是提升並收窄區間以展現確信 (AKAM $4.135–4.205B (AKAM, 2025‑Q2); FTNT $6.65–6.85B (FTNT, 2024‑Q4))。

- 事實 49 — 2025 全年經調整營業利益指引 (PLTR：$2.151–2.155B)：PLTR 給出高額的全年經調整營業利益指引；樣本中有類似的全年經調整營業利益指引例子，但絕對規模與公司體量不同，PLTR 著重高獲利轉換 (DVA $2.01–2.16B 調整後營業利益例子 (DVA, 2024‑Q4))。

- 事實 50 — 2025 全年調整後自由現金流指引 (PLTR：$1.9–2.1B)：PLTR 的 FCF 指引相當可觀且表示上調；樣本中 FCF 指引範圍各異（F $2–3B；ZBH $1–1.2B），PLTR 將自己定位為高現金生成企業 (F $2–3B (F, 2025‑Q3); ZBH $1–1.2B (ZBH, 2025‑Q3))。

- 事實 51 — GAAP 獲利預期 (PLTR：預期全年每季均有 GAAP 營業與淨利)：PLTR 明確承諾每一季均達 GAAP 獲利；樣本中雖有 GAAP 預期說明，但少有如此明確且逐季保證的表述（ALGN 對 GAAP 營業利潤的範圍 13–14% 為較寬鬆的預期例子），PLTR 的語氣更為確定 (ALGN GAAP 營業利潤預期 13–14% (ALGN, 2025‑Q2)).

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

ORIGINAL EARNINGS CALL TRANSCRIPT:
---
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Clare Trachtman: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Ashley McEvoy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Flavia Pease, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Benjamin, Chief Operating Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Insulet's third quarter results along with our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that certain statements, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025. The anticipated impact of our strategic actions, the potential impact of various regulatory and operational matters in the macroeconomic environment on our results of operations contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Insulet's ongoing business performance, including adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted tax rate and constant currency revenue, which is a revenue growth, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and available in our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. During the Q&A session this morning, Ashley, Flavia, Eric and myself will be available to address questions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ashley. Ashley?
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Clare, and welcome. Many of you already know Clare and we're excited to have such a respected and proven professional in her role. I'd like to welcome Flavia, who is joining us for her first call as Insulet's Chief Financial Officer. Flavia is a highly accomplished financial executive with world-class health care and med tech expertise, and we're thrilled to have her with us on the team. Her extensive leadership experience in complex global organizations combined with her proven ability to drive financial performance and create long-term value, make her the ideal CFO to help guide Insulet's next phase of patient-centric growth. Flavia's thoughtful contributions and active engagement as a member of our Board were instrumental to our strong performance and are now enabling a seamless transition. And finally, I'd like to congratulate Eric on his well-deserved promotion to Chief Operating Officer. With more than a decade of experience at Insulet, Eric truly embodies our mission. His relentless drive to innovate and to find a better way has been a cornerstone of our success, and we're excited for the leadership he'll bring in this expanded role. I also want to introduce Manoj Raghunandanan as our Chief Growth Officer. Manoj brings 20 years of consumer health leadership to a newly created role overseeing market development, demand generation, commercial capabilities and our global brand and customer experience. These leadership changes further strengthen our team, bringing proven industry and functional expertise that aligns with Insulet's unique and advantaged position at the nexus of consumer health, health care and med tech. Our vision is a world where diabetes places less burden on daily life until there is a cure. Driven by empathy powered by ingenuity and validated by science, our mission is to transform life with diabetes for people everywhere. Now turning to our results. This was another standout quarter for Insulet, showcasing the durability of our recurring revenue model, which resulted in robust growth and improved profitability. We surpassed $700 million in quarterly revenue for the first time with 28% year-over-year growth at constant currency rates. This performance reflects continued strong retention and a record number of new Podders across the U.S. and globally, including continued acceleration in Type 2. Operating margins expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 17.1%, as we generated operating leverage while continuing to strategically invest in our innovation road map and field expansion. I want to thank the Insulet team for their hard work this quarter and their tireless commitment to delivering for Podders worldwide. We continue to drive progress against our strategic objectives. In the U.S. Type 1 market, we are extending our lead with sequential and year-over-year growth in new customer starts, fueled by ongoing prescriber expansion and the highest number of competitive conversions since late 2023. Our growing prescriber base of more than 27,000 health care professionals underscore the strong return on our investments in expanding our sales force, improving our commercial execution and increasing health care professional education and outreach. In U.S. Type 2, we are seeing strong momentum. New customer starts more than doubled year-over-year and grew sequentially. As we saw with Type 1, the power of real-world outcomes to turn skeptical providers and patients into believers is unmatched. In addition to the tremendous NCS growth, there was a large sequential uptake in Type 2 prescribers this quarter. Encouragingly, this was driven both by increased adoption among our existing Type 1 prescriber base and by our DTC efforts to activate new customers and increase the number of new prescribers. I want to highlight that our strong Type 1 foundation, the familiar prescriber base, our pharmacy access and Part D coverage, along with our brand and community give us a substantial head start in developing the Type 2 market. Our conviction and our ability to unlock the Type 2 opportunity at scale is growing rapidly. Our international business continues to deliver robust growth, reflecting increasing global demand and successful execution. We're seeing consistent momentum across key geographies as we expand access, deepen customer engagement and scale our operations worldwide. Revenue grew 40% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by the continued rollout of Omnipod 5. In established markets like the U.K., France and Germany, we're seeing robust growth supported by our launches of the latest sensor integration as well as ongoing positive price/mix realization from DASH to Omnipod 5 conversions. In Germany, for example, our G7 launch has fueled rapid uptake among new and existing customers. We're also benefiting from growing contributions from markets like Canada and Australia, where Omnipod 5 launched earlier this year and is taking share. [ Eliza and her mom Melissa, ] whom I met while visiting our team in Toronto are among the first Canadians to benefit from Omnipod 5. Just 3 years old, Eliza struggled with overnight glucose control and Melissa rarely sleept through the night. Since starting on Omnipod 5 in April, Eliza has seen her A1C drop from 8.6% to 6.8% and her time in range double. And Melissa and her husband are finally getting a full night sleep. Eliza now loves to dance, swim and it's fast becoming one of the faces of Omnipod in Canada as local demand growth. With more Omnipod 5 rollouts planned in 2026, our opportunities to grow in our existing international markets and help more people like Eliza and Melissa remains significant. Last quarter, I laid out a focused set of investment priorities that will enable us to move faster, deepen our competitive advantage, drive penetration, unlock new opportunities and scale profitably. We will talk in great detail about these long-term priorities in 2 weeks at Investor Day. For now, let me share some of the progress we've made during the quarter. First, innovation. Our focus on accelerating the pace of innovation and being ready to launch alongside our partners is reflected in our integration work with Dexcom's 15-day sensor. When Dexcom launches, so will we. Libre 3 integration in the U.S. is on track for the first half of 2026 and is a top priority. Our experience across our markets shows that bringing new sensors online drive growth. We also continue to promote adoption of phone control. More than 55% of U.S. Omnipod users now control their system via smartphone, up from 45% last quarter. That shift toward app-based control improved convenience, retention, satisfaction and outcomes. Looking further ahead, we've completed recruitment for our STRIVE pivotal trial for next-generation hybrid closed loop and for our Evolution 2 feasibility study for fully closed loop in Type 2. I'm excited to share more about these next-generation products and their market-changing potential at Investor Day. Next is market development. We are pressing the advantages of our unique pay-as-you-go pharmacy access. Omnipod is already easy to access and affordable. Our system is available in more than 47,000 U.S. pharmacies and covered by over 90% of commercial plans allowing us to reach more than 300 million lives. Most users can start on Omnipod for about $1 a day without upfront costs or lock in commitments. Our focus now is addressing the remaining barriers to access with targeted programs aimed at easing the prior authorization submission process, and we're continuing to expand access for underserved populations more than 2/3 of our government insured customers pay less than $10 a month and over 60% pay zero. Third is demand generation. This quarter, we invested meaningfully in DTC investments, and they are yielding record levels of qualified leads. The majority of our DTC leads approximately 65% in the quarter come from patients treated by providers who are not currently called on by our sales force. These patients are actively requesting Omnipod 5, driving awareness and adoption with their providers. Upon seeing patient success, these providers continue to recommend Omnipod 5 creating a powerful flywheel effect that amplifies the return on our DTC investments far beyond the initial demand generated. Finally, its global operational scale. Our manufacturing facilities in Acton and Malaysia are ramping ahead of plan, delivering strong customer service and improved margins. We're accelerating investments to further increase capacity at these facilities to support our strong growth trajectory. And we continue to integrate AI and cloud-based tools to streamline and scale our service operations efficiently. In closing, our momentum and our strategic progress gives us confidence in our outlook and make us excited about the path ahead. Our growth is broad-based and durable. Our business model is scaling profitably. Our opportunities are vast and our team is energized and stronger than ever. We're eager to share deeper insights into our growth strategy, innovation road map and long-term vision in a couple of weeks at Investor Day. I'll now turn the call over to Flavia to discuss our third quarter results and guidance.
Flavia Pease: Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start that it is an honor and a privilege to join Insulet at such an exciting time in the company's journey. Our commitment to improving the lives of people with diabetes is deeply inspiring and I look forward to partnering with Ashley and the entire Insulet team to build on our strong foundation and continue to deliver industry-leading financial performance. With that, I'll turn to our third quarter performance and the outlook ahead. The Insulet team delivered a strong third quarter, marked by total revenues of over $700 million, an increase of 28% at constant currency rates and 30% at reported rates. Foreign currency contributed 170 basis points to third quarter reported growth. Notably, during the quarter, total Omnipod grew 29% as compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, new customer starts grew both on a year-over-year and sequential basis in our U.S. Type 1, U.S. Type 2 and International Type 1 market. And we achieved a record number of total new customer starts in the U.S. and internationally. Similar to previous quarters, over 85% of our U.S. new customer start came from MDI, while competitive switches also contributed to growth. Additionally, more than 35% of our U.S. new starts were from Type 2. Our estimated global utilization and annualized global retention rate remains stable. Overall, our team continues to deliver robust top line growth and improved profitability, resulting in increased earnings per share and strong cash flow generation. I will now walk through some additional details of our performance in the quarter. First, turning to our U.S. and international revenue drivers. U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 25.6% above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued demand for Omnipod 5 across Type 1 and especially among Type 2 customers. As a reminder, U.S. revenue growth this year has been impacted by rebate timing and prior year inventory stocking dynamics. Normalizing for these impacts, U.S. growth in the third quarter was approximately 30 basis points higher, representing an acceleration from normalized second quarter growth levels. In our international Omnipod business, we achieved a revenue growth of 46.5% on a reported basis and 39.9% on a constant currency basis, which was also above the high end of our guidance. International revenues crossed $200 million for the first time. Our growth this quarter was fueled by robust demand for Omnipod 5 underscoring its market appeal and the benefit it delivers to patients. Positive price/mix realization also contributed to performance as customers shift from Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. We continue to see strong growth in the U.K., Germany and France, in addition to other countries where we have launched Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, foreign currency contributed 660 basis points to growth as compared to the prior year. Continuing down the P&L, our third quarter gross margin reached 72.2% reflecting a 290 basis point expansion year-over-year. This improvement was fueled by strong top line growth, supported by higher volumes, manufacturing productivity and favorable pricing. As we all know, innovation is the lifeblood of any company. We remain relentlessly committed to advancing breakthrough solutions and strategically funding initiatives that empower us to better serve our Podders and unlock meaningful incremental value across our portfolio. During the quarter, R&D expenses increased 41%, up 80 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year. This increase in funding is focused on additional resources to support our innovation pipeline and associated clinical development. In addition, stronger-than-expected growth in the quarter created an opportunity to accelerate our commercial investments with a particular focus on demand generation. These investments included our direct-to-consumer campaigns, both digitally and in mass media, to enhance brand awareness globally. This resulted in a record number of DTC leads that will help support future growth. In addition, we expanded our commercial and customer experience teams as we continue to enhance penetration and extend our leadership in both Type 1 and Type 2. We look forward to further discussing many of these initiatives during our upcoming Investor Day on November 20. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.1% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.7%. Our operating margin this quarter underscores the strength of our top line performance, which enables us to continue investing in our innovation road map, and strategically accelerate targeted commercial investments aimed at fueling long-term growth. As Ashley mentioned, we are well positioned to continue investing aggressively for future growth, while also delivering meaningful margin expansion. Our third quarter non-GAAP adjusted tax rate was 22.5%. Turning now to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $760 million in cash and the full $500 million available under our credit facility. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our financial flexibility and lower our cost of capital. We have now successfully eliminated all convertible debt from our capital structure, by extinguishing $800 million of our convertible notes due in 2026 and the cap calls associated with the notes. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 91,000 shares for $30 million. These purchases are intended to offset dilution from stock-based compensation. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025. As the newly appointed CFO, one of my priorities is to evaluate and refine our guidance practices. My goal is to ensure these practices reflect the key drivers of shareholder value and provide investors with a clear understanding of our business and strategic direction. I believe guidance should reflect a balanced outlook for the business and acknowledge potential risks and uncertainties as well as potential upside opportunities. Our objective going forward will be focused on providing guidance that reflects a high degree of confidence in achieving while endeavoring to be more reflective of the underlying momentum in our business. Starting with the fourth quarter, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 27% to 30% and total company growth of 25% to 28%. On a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 200 basis points from foreign currency. We expect fourth quarter U.S. Omnipod growth of 24% to 27% and international Omnipod growth of 37% to 40%. In our international business, on a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 1,000 basis points from foreign currency. Turning to our full year 2025 outlook. We're raising our total Omnipod revenue growth to 29% to 30% from prior guidance of 25% to 28%. We're also raising our total company revenue growth to 28% to 29% from 24% to 27%. We expect favorable impact of approximately 100 basis points from foreign currency for the year. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth to 26% to 27% from 22% to 25%, driven by increased penetration from MDI users and competitive gains. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in U.S. new customer starts for the year. As a reminder, our U.S. growth guidance also assumes similar trends in pricing, utilization and retention as we saw in 2024. For international Omnipod, we're raising our revenue guidance to 38% to 39% from 34% to 37%. On a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 500 basis points from foreign currency. Like the U.S., we expect year-over-year growth in international new customer starts for the year. While volume remains the primary driver of our international revenue growth, our guidance also reflects a benefit from positive price/mix realization as customers transition from Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. We're also assuming stable utilization and slightly improving retention for 2025 relative to 2024. Turning to 2025 gross margin. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect full year gross margin of more than 71% as compared to our prior guidance of approximately 71%. We're also narrowing our outlook for operating margin. We now expect operating margin to be between 17.3% and 17.5%, reflecting stronger top line growth and continued investments in R&D, market development and demand generation. The updated outlook represents a 240 to 260 basis point improvement over the prior year period. We remain committed to enhancing profitability and will continue to deliver meaningful operating margin expansion year-over-year. At the same time, we're scaling our investments thoughtfully to support our long-term growth ambitions and ensure sustained value creation. Looking at a few items below our operating income. We now expect our 2025 net interest expense to be approximately $20 million higher than 2024 due to the transition from convertible debt to traditional debt, which carries higher coupon rates and the extension of our interest rate swaps. For the year, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We also expect the 2025 ending balance of our diluted share count to be around $71 million, which is approximately 5% or 3.5 million shares lower than prior year due to the extinguishment of our convertible debt. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong free cash flow in 2025 compared to 2024 supported by robust growth and continued margin expansion. We anticipate a meaningful increase in capital expenditures during the fourth quarter as we invest strategically to enable long-term growth. As highlighted last quarter, we are actively assessing opportunities to accelerate our manufacturing expansion plans and look forward to sharing further updates at our upcoming Investor Day. Our team remains steadfast in its commitment to driving top-tier growth, expanding margins and increasing profitability and free cash flow. These efforts are central to our long-term value creation strategy and enable us to reach and serve more people with diabetes around the world. Finally, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire Insulet team for the warm welcome over the past month. Your dedication to our mission and your unwavering commitment to improving the lives of people with diabetes, inspire me every day. I'm excited to be part of this journey with you. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the speakers available for Q&A today are Ashley McEvoy, Flavia Pease and Eric Benjamin. Our first question is from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.
Robert Marcus: Good morning and congrats on a great quarter, and welcome Flavia. I wanted to ask sort of a higher level question. Another great quarter, good -- record new patient growth, U.S., outside the U.S., 85% from MDI. [ Again ] double-digit new patient growth in Type 1 and Type 2 in the U.S. So clearly, Omnipod 5 appears to be winning, both U.S. and outside U.S. There's a lot more noise in the marketplace. A lot of people are talking about patch pumps. You're about to go from 2 public competitors to 3 public competitors and it seems like there's just a lot more noise out there, but you're coming above the crowd and delivering the best results. So maybe just walk us through where and how Omnipod 5 is winning? Is it just form factor? Is it the algorithm? Is it the easier onboarding? And really, just what's going on in the field? And what gives you the confidence you can continue to deliver great results like this.
Ashley McEvoy: Thanks, Robbie, for the question. I would just frame to say it's really broad-based, balanced growth, which really is showing that our strategy is working. It's really a combination of very strong, compelling science as evidenced by our SECURE-T2D trial, our RADIANT trial, as well as our very compelling real-world evidence. The second is we really do have this beloved brand. Customers love our differentiated form factor, and we're going to continue to stay ahead of the curve in that regard. Third really is around our differentiated access and affordability. Fourth is really, I would say, our supply chain. We've invested over $1 billion over the years to create a highly resilient supply chain that can scale at very competitive cost. We're producing millions of pods. And then I would say the last is just the flexibility of our balance sheet to be able to continue to invest in innovation to really -- to continue to stay as a market leader.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
David Roman: I wanted just to start on the Type 2s. You're about a year into having the indication for Type 2 in the U.S., I guess it was last August of '24. Can you talk a little bit more about how the adoption is built over the past year, where we are in kind of an uptake? And how we should think about that segment going forward? And maybe just perhaps related to that, you talked about DTC advertising as one of the big drivers here of SG&A growth in the quarter. Can you just maybe help pull the thread all the way through from that investment to new patient starts to revenue and maybe how that ties to the Type 2 adoption as well?
Ashley McEvoy: Yes, sure. Thank you, David. It's great to be a year into this. And I would say, like let me first start with, it's a very large TAM in the U.S. with Type 2. And I think that we're starting from a position of strength, which is really our 25 years of serving people with Type 1 diabetes. As you know, that there is a very similar call point there, starting with endos. And what we really saw in quarter 3 is echoed is that prescribers that are prescribing Type 1 for AID are also now prescribing Type 2. And not only is it giving birth to accelerated Type 2 adoption, it's also helping the prescribing behavior for Omnipod among the Type 1 community. We saw in Type 2 that our -- the prescriber base went up 26% in the quarter. Year-over-year NTS is up 100% and quarter-over-quarter was up 26%. And I would say it's really a combination of: one, strong science, as I first spoke about earlier. Two, it's around the leverage that we have invested with this call point on reputation and science. And three, we have activated some meaningful investment in DTC this past quarter, where we saw a very strong amount of leads from people who we do not call on. And we got -- we were able to kind of get those new colleagues on to pod. So I would say all three of those is what's giving us nice momentum 1 year into this launch of Type 2 with many years ahead.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Joanne Wuensch from Citigroup.
Joanne Wuensch: I too am going to go for a big picture question. It is rare that we see an entire new team from the CEO to the CFO to Investor Relations and just watching a company knock fall out. So I'm really curious what the 3 of you or 2 of you or collectively are planning to do differently to keep this momentum generally.
Ashley McEvoy: Well, listen, thank you, Joanne. I have to first say it's really a nice combination to see some very strong talent elevated, taking over more responsibility in the company. People like Amit Guliani, who is now our new Chief Technology Officer, people like Eric Benjamin, who spent nearly a decade at Insulet now assuming the post as Chief Operating Officer. And then obviously welcoming Flavia and some new capability with Manoj. I would describe it, Joanne, as the following. We have a remarkable technology. We sell on passion. We're going to sell more on science. We have invested ahead of the curve of our supply chain, which is giving us really scale affordability. And we now are the market leader, and we spent 25 years working on disrupting the market leader, we now are the market leader. So we are going to really start to continue to invest in things like market development and demand generation to create that endurable competitive moat going forward.
Flavia Pease: Yes. Joanne, just to add, as Ashley has said, even in her first 6 months, I think what all of us that are newer to the team inherent is a strategic and capital allocation strategy that are going to -- remain intact. We're just going to continue to build from a very strong foundation. And in my first 30 days, I've really been focusing on just continuing to understand those priorities, our innovation road map, our commercial plans and then the significant opportunities that we have to continue expanding penetration in this large market we operate in. And then going forward, how can I partner with the team to further activate levers that are going to allow us to continue delivering sustainable top-tier growth, expanding our margins and ensuring that we continue to execute with discipline and precision. So it's a really great time to be joining the Insulet team now in this new capacity and continue to improve the lives of people with diabetes and deliver shareholder value, so.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America.
Travis Steed: Maybe I'll start with maybe just high level, some kind of puts and takes on '26 and how we should think about the year with Libre integration possibly and Type 2 accelerating. Can you continue to put up record new starts? And I wanted to also touch on the evaluate and refine our guidance practices. If you could elaborate on that, I think you said reflect the balanced outlook for the business and acknowledge potential risk. So I just wanted to make sure I elaborate on how you think about guidance going forward.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Travis. I'll start and I'll turn it to Flavia later. I would say clearly, we're really pleased with the momentum that we have in the U.S. and O.U.S., and we see a clear pathway to delivering continued top-tier growth, really backed by these proven leadership in these very large underpenetrated markets. And I think that we're confident in the strong growth and improved profitability when we expect that to continue in 2026. So we're going to provide '26 specific guidelines on our quarter 4 call. Consistent with historical practice. But I'll turn it over to Flavia to speak a little bit about your philosophy on guidance.
Flavia Pease: Yes. Thanks, Ashley. Travis. So obviously, we set guidance with the intent to deliver, and that is clearly not changing. I think what we will try to do as we continue to mature and evolve as an organization is trying to have a balanced view of our expectations, acknowledging that there are risks and uncertainties but also potential upside opportunities. So we are not changing how we guide other than ensuring that we have a balanced view going forward. I think we're also, as Clare and I continue to onboard and going forward into 2026, we look into what KPIs make the most sense to continue to provide as drivers of the performance of the business and help shareholders really understand our strategic direction. So we might evolve a little bit the metrics that we focus on and guide to, but more to come on that when we guide to 2026.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird.
Jeffrey Johnson: Ashley, I'm sure that you're going to get a lot of these questions here for the next year or 2. But just as we see 2-piece patch potential market entrances over the next 18 to 24 months or so, I'd love to hear kind of some early and I'm sure we'll get more at the Analyst Day, but kind of early thoughts you have on how you protect and maybe even extend your competitive moat there on the patch pump side.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Jeff. I would say, first of all, we really -- our key focus is about expanding the market and really taking people from MDI into the market, and we continue to lead the market. You'll hear more about this at Investor Day about kind of the performance, the percent of growth that Insulet has driven for the category has really been the majority, not a surprise. And so we want to continue to focus on our efforts of making AID accessible and available to as many patients as possible coming from MDI therapy. Now as you've heard us talk about, actually, this quarter, we did experience one of the strongest quarters in the past 2 years of sourcing also competitively. And I think that, that speaks to just the highly differentiated technology that Omnipod 5 is delivering for more customers around the world. I think it speaks to the investments we've been doing in making it a very frictionless customer experience from how we first make them aware of the product, whether that be through DTC or whether that be through their prescriber and then get them on pod and then keep them on pod. It's the investments, Jeff, that we're making in our pipeline that you're going to hear a lot more about in Investor Day. We spoke about in quarter 3, getting people, more people on phone control, going from 45% to 55%. We shared at the ADA real-world evidence, which showed that more people who are on phone control bolus more often. That's a really good thing for health outcomes. And you're going to see us continue to invest so that we are always staying ahead of the curve of demand on capacity investments and making sure that we continue to have a very diversified, very resilient supply chain that allows us to serve more Podders around the world.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: I have a question on the outside United States performance, obviously, remarkably good. Now for 2 years running and it seems at this stage is set for this to continue into '26. I'm just -- I want to make sure models this year are kind of properly based as we go into next. Is there anything on the volume side as you roll out O5 and convert from DASH. I hear the price and mix stuff, but on volume kind of first fill dynamics, distributor stocking, these were positive influences called out as O5 rolled out in the U.S., I haven't heard anything about this O.U.S. Anything for us to keep in mind as we move into the next couple of years internationally?
Ashley McEvoy: Yes. Let me just start, Mike, and I'll turn to Flavia. I would say we have very robust durable growth in O.U.S. performance. And what we're seeing are the conversion, I would say, the upgrades of turning some of our DASH markets into Omnipod 5 markets. And we are benefiting some price materialization, but also a very accelerated volume uptick. And that's what's really enabling this business and internationally to post performance to like 40% and to have some of our NGS looking at 68% growth. I'll turn it over to Flavia.
Flavia Pease: Yes, Michael. So to your specific question, there is no material or immaterial, for that matter, impact of distributor stocking in the quarter or over the last several quarters. To Ashley's point, the growth internationally really has been primarily driven by volume. There is a bit of price/mix realization as you pointed out, as we continue to upgrade from DASH to Omnipod 5. And we are also not -- we still have headroom to go on that conversion. But again, the primary driver is volume, and there's no noise on stocking.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
Gursimran Kaur: This is Simran on for Larry. I guess I just wanted to focus a little bit more on U.S. Omnipod. Obviously, a really strong quarter, and it looks like you raised your guidance by more than double the beat. What exactly is driving the upside to U.S. expectations from kind of how you were guiding previously. And I guess, should we kind of continue to think about U.S. new starts on a quarterly basis being record new starts here moving forward. And just a little bit more about how should we think about sort of sustainability of some of those underlying trends that you're seeing in the U.S. business going forward?
Ashley McEvoy: Yes. Thank you for the question. Again, I'm going to say it's really a combination of both. Our core business, which has been Type 1 in the U.S., which is the site being in this business for 25 years, the penetration is still 40%. We still have a lot of upside. And we still have a lot of -- still clinical inertia that behavior of clinical prescribing behavior is not matching the ADI standard of care guidelines, which is to recommend AID therapy at the point of diagnosis. So we are going to continue to educate in that regard, and we have been doing that specifically in quarter 3, and we're seeing uptick of increased prescribing behavior. In addition to that, we -- obviously, it's Type 2. We've been at this for over -- for a year. Unbelievably low penetration rates, less than mid-single digit and with a lot of upside. And we are taking the science to the street is what I call, which is really about educating predominantly endocrinologists first, as well as high-prescribing PCPs on the science and the state of science and adoption of care. And really arming our field to go educate in that regard, doing a lot of peer-to-peer education of AID evangelist, if you will, and making sure that they can help with adoption in the Type 2 community. And then you also heard us talk about activating directly with consumers to make them aware that if they are someone with Type 2 diabetes, they should be seeking out a prescriber and asking them about Omnipod. And that has resulted in very meaningful lead in quarter 3. So it's very balanced on continuing to get strong performance from our core as well as getting really accelerated momentum with our new indication and our new customer base of people with Type 2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor from Jefferies.
Unknown Analyst: All right. This is [ Matt ] on for Matt Taylor. I just wanted to ask maybe one specific question on kind of contracting in the pharmacy channel. So as you see kind of more competition come in there, would you characterize any differences in your contracting dynamics that is anything on price or tenor?
Ashley McEvoy: Matt, thank you for the question. I would -- the short answer to that is, no. I would say that we've been at this for almost 8, 9 years of really kind of leading the pay-as-you-go business model in the pharmacy. Not only where people can pick up their insulin in about 47,000 pharmacies but equally with payers around taking the very strong health economic story and clinical outcome story to payers that has really enabled us to procure 300 million lives out of 317 million available lives and the majority of those at a preferred status. And so we -- for the majority, it translates to about $1 a day. And we're also working with a lot of our patients who have the government as some of their payers to make sure that they have good affordability and access. So I would say right now, we're really focusing our efforts on the very few minority where they are getting stuck, if you will, on prior authorities to really streamline that approval process. We've seen a meaningful uptick in our ability to -- in essence, get that need from 75% getting prior office through with like 90% completion rate. Again, that's the minority because we -- the majority, we have preferred status and you do not need a prior auth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from Truist Securities.
Felipe Lamar: This is Felipe on for Rich. Just on converting Type 2 patients, could you just talk about how maybe the customer acquisition cost compares to that of Type 1? And just maybe how your scale could give you an advantage over the long-term in converting that patient population considering how early we are in adoption stages.
Ashley McEvoy: Yes. Thank you. And I would just say it's a great question, we're always looking at. We're not going to share that with us with you all the time, but we do look at the cost to acquire and the cost to serve and the lifetime value of our customer base. And the person who is leading all that work is Eric Benjamin. So Eric, why don't you talk about that?
Eric Benjamin: Thanks for the question. And just a little bit of color. As Ashley described earlier, we have the advantage of having a common call point that we've been in for 25 years as we've built the Type 1 business. And those are folks who are already prescribing AID for Type 1 who are familiar with technology, and so it's a really strong commercial synergy to be able to bring the SECURE-T2D data to that call point and help turn that existing call point already come full of technology into advocates and believers in AID for Type 2. And that's been a big part of our initial launch strategy is activating our current call point, which has high commercial synergies and is really efficient. We still have opportunity there. So we've had nice success activating that call point, we have more to go. So Richard, there's some -- there's a good tailwind there that we're building on. In addition, we're activating new prescribers. And obviously, we watch those efficiency metrics closely. In the early days as we're getting folks to start-up that is a higher cost, it takes some time to educate new providers on the benefits of Omnipod and how technology works. We've gotten good at it and folks know that Omnipod is easy to write, and we see high interest from new writers when our team enters new accounts to get them ramped. So as we're expanding the call point, we're doing that effectively and efficiently with a close eye on overall customer acquisition cost.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel.
Jonathan Block: Actually, maybe a little bit high level, but I'm just curious, DTC driving solid leads, spoke favorably to that and type 2 in the quarter already surpassing 35% of U.S. new starts. So at a high level, like any refined thoughts on where pump penetration can go within the T2II segment of the market? Just based on what you're seeing to date, would love to hear your thoughts.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Jon. And we hope you're coming to our Investor Day on November 20 in Acton, because we have been long waiting kind of share our story, if you will, of what we think our growth algorithm is and what our pipeline looks like and showcase our talent and really our steely determination to go serve more Podders. I would say a couple of things around Type 2. I mean it is a very large underpenetrated market in the U.S. It is globally as well. Right now, we're indicated for the U.S. And as Eric mentioned, I think our approach is differentiated versus maybe what some other offerings may be happening in the marketplace. And that really is around first starting with the equity that we've made with the call base over the past 25 years with Type 1 diabetes. And there's beautiful synergistic value that we've earned over 25 years, and we're going to parlay that into -- for the people with the Type 2 community. Interestingly enough endos write more scripts for people with Type 2 diabetes than they are for their Type 1 for AID therapy in the U.S. of what we're experiencing. And so I think we're going to couple that with continuing to invest in the science and continuing to invest in innovation and making it a frictionless experience. And then continue to invest in the supply chain. And last is kind of activating using the power of brand to make AID therapy seem less scary, if you will, of activating our DTC efforts, which really activates consumers to go ask for Omnipod specifically.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from UBS.
Danielle Antalffy: Congrats on a good quarter there. And sorry about that, Eric. It's not often you get to say good morning, ladies as a group. So I couldn't resist. But just a question following up on the Type 2 versus Type 1, but more around endos versus primary care. And Eric, I was just curious if maybe you could talk a little bit about the difference in the go-to-market strategy, number one, between the two? And then number two, though, maybe more relevant how you guys think you are positioned right now within primary care? How much runway is there still to go to get some of these doctors online and prescribing?
Eric Benjamin: Danielle, thanks for the question. So a couple of things. It is two different calls that our team makes as you described. So we've been in the specialty call point for 25 years. Those folks know about technology. They know how to write technology. And so there, we're selling science. We're selling the benefits of Omnipod, and we're selling the fact that we're the #1 prescribed product that should be first line for folks who are considering AID and that message resonates. As we go beyond, so we expanded the sales force very actively earlier this year to call on another decile of primary care providers this year and that was effective. And as we make those calls and expand the call point, it's an activation. So it's a nurture call where we're introducing technology often to offices that haven't prescribed AID before. We're very thoughtful about going into places that have high opportunities, so they see and treat a lot of diabetes. And Omnipod is as strong proven outcomes, is easy to use, is differentiated. And our team can assess pretty quickly whether it's an office that's ready to become a regular AID writer or whether we just go activate a patient, for example, who may have been interested in technology from DTC on more of a one-off basis. So we're very selective about that to make sure that we're making the commercial investments and building the relationships that will turn into long-term writers, but we also make sure that we have DTC leads that we can serve those patients effectively. The bottom line is we see a lot of runway to be able to do that effectively as we keep ramping our commercial strength in the market and the team is executing really well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.
Matthew O'Brien: Welcome Flavia. The commentary about your highest competitive conversion rate in years was interesting to me. Is that a global comment? Or is that just domestic focused? And if it is global, can you just talk a little bit more about what's really driving that? I mean what's new? I know Omnipod 5 was great, but the sudden acceleration in terms of competitive conversions is kind of unique versus what you've been doing and what you've been seeing. So any commentary there would be very helpful.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Matthew. I'll start and maybe turn to Eric. That is a U.S. number, just to clarify, and I would say, while we've been in the U.S. with Omnipod 5 for coming up on 3 years and we weren't the first AID. I think what we're seeing is the highly differentiated form factor that customers love. We hear that again and again from all of our Pod community. We hear, I would say, the comfort level that prescribers are getting with Omnipod 5 performance backed by very strong evidence. So the SECURE-T2D, as well as the RADIANT, as well as real-world evidence is showing that it works. It reduces A1c, it improves time and range. It prevents lows. It doesn't promote weight gain. In fact, you have to use less insulin. That's a very compelling value proposition. And then coupled with the, I would say, very differentiated access and affordability of really pioneering the pay-as-you-go business model in pharmacy where people pick up their insulin and really working with payers to demonstrate our health economics and clinical outcomes to go get preferred status. That really is driving increased adoption. And it's really enabling Omnipod 5 to be the preferred AID of choice, and that's what's enabling our market leadership now for Type 1, but also the Type 2 indication. And so I still think we're very, very early innings of this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic of Canaccord.
William Plovanic: It's really -- I wanted to go back to the DTC marketing you outlined actually. And I think I heard a discussion on both the digital and the mass media and then also I'm kind of curious, there was some commentary regarding the prescribers and the patients. So -- and I wanted you to kind of -- if I heard that right, and if any color there would be appreciated.
Ashley McEvoy: Thanks, Bill. I'm going to turn it to Eric to talk about DTC.
Eric Benjamin: Bill, it's Eric. So Bill, when we do demand generation three things happen that all work together. The first is we've built a proven demand generation engine where we can produce leads, so interested qualified customers who are interested in Omnipod. That's effective. The two things that we also described are those folks then show up in physician offices and health care providers really appreciate a motivated customer asking about technology. We're creating a new market here, especially in Type 2, where there is some skepticism in the market about whether folks who live with Type 2 diabetes are ready for technology. And so when an activated lead walks into a health care provider office and asks for Omnipod, it's either that conversation for the health care provider and helps the health care providers see that technology is good for that population. So we see that, too. And finally, we had about 65% of the leads that we generated in the quarter are actually from customers that were cared for by folks with whom we don't have a direct sales relationship. And so those become warm invitations for our team to go have a conversation with those health care providers and assess might they be good prescribers of Omnipod for the future. So those are the three things happening with our demand generation DTC efforts.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A section. I would like to turn the conference back to Ashley McEvoy.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you for joining. And I just wanted to also just thank the Insulet team. It's been a very strong quarter, and I'm very proud of how they continue to serve many more Podders around the world, and thank you for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Insulet Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Clare Trachtman, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Clare Trachtman: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Ashley McEvoy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Flavia Pease, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Benjamin, Chief Operating Officer. On the call this morning, we will be discussing Insulet's third quarter results along with our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025. With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that certain statements, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025. The anticipated impact of our strategic actions, the potential impact of various regulatory and operational matters in the macroeconomic environment on our results of operations contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. And of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to today's press release and our SEC filings for more detail concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. In addition, on today's call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Insulet's ongoing business performance, including adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted tax rate and constant currency revenue, which is a revenue growth, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. A reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures being discussed today to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying investor presentation and available in our earnings release issued this morning, which are both available on our website. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all financial commentary regarding dollar and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year reported basis with the exception of revenue growth rates, which will be on a year-over-year constant currency basis. During the Q&A session this morning, Ashley, Flavia, Eric and myself will be available to address questions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ashley. Ashley?
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Clare, and welcome. Many of you already know Clare and we're excited to have such a respected and proven professional in her role. I'd like to welcome Flavia, who is joining us for her first call as Insulet's Chief Financial Officer. Flavia is a highly accomplished financial executive with world-class health care and med tech expertise, and we're thrilled to have her with us on the team. Her extensive leadership experience in complex global organizations combined with her proven ability to drive financial performance and create long-term value, make her the ideal CFO to help guide Insulet's next phase of patient-centric growth. Flavia's thoughtful contributions and active engagement as a member of our Board were instrumental to our strong performance and are now enabling a seamless transition. And finally, I'd like to congratulate Eric on his well-deserved promotion to Chief Operating Officer. With more than a decade of experience at Insulet, Eric truly embodies our mission. His relentless drive to innovate and to find a better way has been a cornerstone of our success, and we're excited for the leadership he'll bring in this expanded role. I also want to introduce Manoj Raghunandanan as our Chief Growth Officer. Manoj brings 20 years of consumer health leadership to a newly created role overseeing market development, demand generation, commercial capabilities and our global brand and customer experience. These leadership changes further strengthen our team, bringing proven industry and functional expertise that aligns with Insulet's unique and advantaged position at the nexus of consumer health, health care and med tech. Our vision is a world where diabetes places less burden on daily life until there is a cure. Driven by empathy powered by ingenuity and validated by science, our mission is to transform life with diabetes for people everywhere. Now turning to our results. This was another standout quarter for Insulet, showcasing the durability of our recurring revenue model, which resulted in robust growth and improved profitability. We surpassed $700 million in quarterly revenue for the first time with 28% year-over-year growth at constant currency rates. This performance reflects continued strong retention and a record number of new Podders across the U.S. and globally, including continued acceleration in Type 2. Operating margins expanded 90 basis points year-over-year to 17.1%, as we generated operating leverage while continuing to strategically invest in our innovation road map and field expansion. I want to thank the Insulet team for their hard work this quarter and their tireless commitment to delivering for Podders worldwide. We continue to drive progress against our strategic objectives. In the U.S. Type 1 market, we are extending our lead with sequential and year-over-year growth in new customer starts, fueled by ongoing prescriber expansion and the highest number of competitive conversions since late 2023. Our growing prescriber base of more than 27,000 health care professionals underscore the strong return on our investments in expanding our sales force, improving our commercial execution and increasing health care professional education and outreach. In U.S. Type 2, we are seeing strong momentum. New customer starts more than doubled year-over-year and grew sequentially. As we saw with Type 1, the power of real-world outcomes to turn skeptical providers and patients into believers is unmatched. In addition to the tremendous NCS growth, there was a large sequential uptake in Type 2 prescribers this quarter. Encouragingly, this was driven both by increased adoption among our existing Type 1 prescriber base and by our DTC efforts to activate new customers and increase the number of new prescribers. I want to highlight that our strong Type 1 foundation, the familiar prescriber base, our pharmacy access and Part D coverage, along with our brand and community give us a substantial head start in developing the Type 2 market. Our conviction and our ability to unlock the Type 2 opportunity at scale is growing rapidly. Our international business continues to deliver robust growth, reflecting increasing global demand and successful execution. We're seeing consistent momentum across key geographies as we expand access, deepen customer engagement and scale our operations worldwide. Revenue grew 40% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by the continued rollout of Omnipod 5. In established markets like the U.K., France and Germany, we're seeing robust growth supported by our launches of the latest sensor integration as well as ongoing positive price/mix realization from DASH to Omnipod 5 conversions. In Germany, for example, our G7 launch has fueled rapid uptake among new and existing customers. We're also benefiting from growing contributions from markets like Canada and Australia, where Omnipod 5 launched earlier this year and is taking share. [ Eliza and her mom Melissa, ] whom I met while visiting our team in Toronto are among the first Canadians to benefit from Omnipod 5. Just 3 years old, Eliza struggled with overnight glucose control and Melissa rarely sleept through the night. Since starting on Omnipod 5 in April, Eliza has seen her A1C drop from 8.6% to 6.8% and her time in range double. And Melissa and her husband are finally getting a full night sleep. Eliza now loves to dance, swim and it's fast becoming one of the faces of Omnipod in Canada as local demand growth. With more Omnipod 5 rollouts planned in 2026, our opportunities to grow in our existing international markets and help more people like Eliza and Melissa remains significant. Last quarter, I laid out a focused set of investment priorities that will enable us to move faster, deepen our competitive advantage, drive penetration, unlock new opportunities and scale profitably. We will talk in great detail about these long-term priorities in 2 weeks at Investor Day. For now, let me share some of the progress we've made during the quarter. First, innovation. Our focus on accelerating the pace of innovation and being ready to launch alongside our partners is reflected in our integration work with Dexcom's 15-day sensor. When Dexcom launches, so will we. Libre 3 integration in the U.S. is on track for the first half of 2026 and is a top priority. Our experience across our markets shows that bringing new sensors online drive growth. We also continue to promote adoption of phone control. More than 55% of U.S. Omnipod users now control their system via smartphone, up from 45% last quarter. That shift toward app-based control improved convenience, retention, satisfaction and outcomes. Looking further ahead, we've completed recruitment for our STRIVE pivotal trial for next-generation hybrid closed loop and for our Evolution 2 feasibility study for fully closed loop in Type 2. I'm excited to share more about these next-generation products and their market-changing potential at Investor Day. Next is market development. We are pressing the advantages of our unique pay-as-you-go pharmacy access. Omnipod is already easy to access and affordable. Our system is available in more than 47,000 U.S. pharmacies and covered by over 90% of commercial plans allowing us to reach more than 300 million lives. Most users can start on Omnipod for about $1 a day without upfront costs or lock in commitments. Our focus now is addressing the remaining barriers to access with targeted programs aimed at easing the prior authorization submission process, and we're continuing to expand access for underserved populations more than 2/3 of our government insured customers pay less than $10 a month and over 60% pay zero. Third is demand generation. This quarter, we invested meaningfully in DTC investments, and they are yielding record levels of qualified leads. The majority of our DTC leads approximately 65% in the quarter come from patients treated by providers who are not currently called on by our sales force. These patients are actively requesting Omnipod 5, driving awareness and adoption with their providers. Upon seeing patient success, these providers continue to recommend Omnipod 5 creating a powerful flywheel effect that amplifies the return on our DTC investments far beyond the initial demand generated. Finally, its global operational scale. Our manufacturing facilities in Acton and Malaysia are ramping ahead of plan, delivering strong customer service and improved margins. We're accelerating investments to further increase capacity at these facilities to support our strong growth trajectory. And we continue to integrate AI and cloud-based tools to streamline and scale our service operations efficiently. In closing, our momentum and our strategic progress gives us confidence in our outlook and make us excited about the path ahead. Our growth is broad-based and durable. Our business model is scaling profitably. Our opportunities are vast and our team is energized and stronger than ever. We're eager to share deeper insights into our growth strategy, innovation road map and long-term vision in a couple of weeks at Investor Day. I'll now turn the call over to Flavia to discuss our third quarter results and guidance.
Flavia Pease: Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start that it is an honor and a privilege to join Insulet at such an exciting time in the company's journey. Our commitment to improving the lives of people with diabetes is deeply inspiring and I look forward to partnering with Ashley and the entire Insulet team to build on our strong foundation and continue to deliver industry-leading financial performance. With that, I'll turn to our third quarter performance and the outlook ahead. The Insulet team delivered a strong third quarter, marked by total revenues of over $700 million, an increase of 28% at constant currency rates and 30% at reported rates. Foreign currency contributed 170 basis points to third quarter reported growth. Notably, during the quarter, total Omnipod grew 29% as compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis. During the quarter, new customer starts grew both on a year-over-year and sequential basis in our U.S. Type 1, U.S. Type 2 and International Type 1 market. And we achieved a record number of total new customer starts in the U.S. and internationally. Similar to previous quarters, over 85% of our U.S. new customer start came from MDI, while competitive switches also contributed to growth. Additionally, more than 35% of our U.S. new starts were from Type 2. Our estimated global utilization and annualized global retention rate remains stable. Overall, our team continues to deliver robust top line growth and improved profitability, resulting in increased earnings per share and strong cash flow generation. I will now walk through some additional details of our performance in the quarter. First, turning to our U.S. and international revenue drivers. U.S. Omnipod revenue grew 25.6% above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued demand for Omnipod 5 across Type 1 and especially among Type 2 customers. As a reminder, U.S. revenue growth this year has been impacted by rebate timing and prior year inventory stocking dynamics. Normalizing for these impacts, U.S. growth in the third quarter was approximately 30 basis points higher, representing an acceleration from normalized second quarter growth levels. In our international Omnipod business, we achieved a revenue growth of 46.5% on a reported basis and 39.9% on a constant currency basis, which was also above the high end of our guidance. International revenues crossed $200 million for the first time. Our growth this quarter was fueled by robust demand for Omnipod 5 underscoring its market appeal and the benefit it delivers to patients. Positive price/mix realization also contributed to performance as customers shift from Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. We continue to see strong growth in the U.K., Germany and France, in addition to other countries where we have launched Omnipod 5. On a reported basis, foreign currency contributed 660 basis points to growth as compared to the prior year. Continuing down the P&L, our third quarter gross margin reached 72.2% reflecting a 290 basis point expansion year-over-year. This improvement was fueled by strong top line growth, supported by higher volumes, manufacturing productivity and favorable pricing. As we all know, innovation is the lifeblood of any company. We remain relentlessly committed to advancing breakthrough solutions and strategically funding initiatives that empower us to better serve our Podders and unlock meaningful incremental value across our portfolio. During the quarter, R&D expenses increased 41%, up 80 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the prior year. This increase in funding is focused on additional resources to support our innovation pipeline and associated clinical development. In addition, stronger-than-expected growth in the quarter created an opportunity to accelerate our commercial investments with a particular focus on demand generation. These investments included our direct-to-consumer campaigns, both digitally and in mass media, to enhance brand awareness globally. This resulted in a record number of DTC leads that will help support future growth. In addition, we expanded our commercial and customer experience teams as we continue to enhance penetration and extend our leadership in both Type 1 and Type 2. We look forward to further discussing many of these initiatives during our upcoming Investor Day on November 20. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.1% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.7%. Our operating margin this quarter underscores the strength of our top line performance, which enables us to continue investing in our innovation road map, and strategically accelerate targeted commercial investments aimed at fueling long-term growth. As Ashley mentioned, we are well positioned to continue investing aggressively for future growth, while also delivering meaningful margin expansion. Our third quarter non-GAAP adjusted tax rate was 22.5%. Turning now to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with approximately $760 million in cash and the full $500 million available under our credit facility. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our financial flexibility and lower our cost of capital. We have now successfully eliminated all convertible debt from our capital structure, by extinguishing $800 million of our convertible notes due in 2026 and the cap calls associated with the notes. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 91,000 shares for $30 million. These purchases are intended to offset dilution from stock-based compensation. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2025. As the newly appointed CFO, one of my priorities is to evaluate and refine our guidance practices. My goal is to ensure these practices reflect the key drivers of shareholder value and provide investors with a clear understanding of our business and strategic direction. I believe guidance should reflect a balanced outlook for the business and acknowledge potential risks and uncertainties as well as potential upside opportunities. Our objective going forward will be focused on providing guidance that reflects a high degree of confidence in achieving while endeavoring to be more reflective of the underlying momentum in our business. Starting with the fourth quarter, we expect total Omnipod revenue growth of 27% to 30% and total company growth of 25% to 28%. On a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 200 basis points from foreign currency. We expect fourth quarter U.S. Omnipod growth of 24% to 27% and international Omnipod growth of 37% to 40%. In our international business, on a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 1,000 basis points from foreign currency. Turning to our full year 2025 outlook. We're raising our total Omnipod revenue growth to 29% to 30% from prior guidance of 25% to 28%. We're also raising our total company revenue growth to 28% to 29% from 24% to 27%. We expect favorable impact of approximately 100 basis points from foreign currency for the year. For U.S. Omnipod, we are raising our revenue growth to 26% to 27% from 22% to 25%, driven by increased penetration from MDI users and competitive gains. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in U.S. new customer starts for the year. As a reminder, our U.S. growth guidance also assumes similar trends in pricing, utilization and retention as we saw in 2024. For international Omnipod, we're raising our revenue guidance to 38% to 39% from 34% to 37%. On a reported basis, we expect a favorable impact of approximately 500 basis points from foreign currency. Like the U.S., we expect year-over-year growth in international new customer starts for the year. While volume remains the primary driver of our international revenue growth, our guidance also reflects a benefit from positive price/mix realization as customers transition from Omnipod DASH to Omnipod 5. We're also assuming stable utilization and slightly improving retention for 2025 relative to 2024. Turning to 2025 gross margin. Given our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect full year gross margin of more than 71% as compared to our prior guidance of approximately 71%. We're also narrowing our outlook for operating margin. We now expect operating margin to be between 17.3% and 17.5%, reflecting stronger top line growth and continued investments in R&D, market development and demand generation. The updated outlook represents a 240 to 260 basis point improvement over the prior year period. We remain committed to enhancing profitability and will continue to deliver meaningful operating margin expansion year-over-year. At the same time, we're scaling our investments thoughtfully to support our long-term growth ambitions and ensure sustained value creation. Looking at a few items below our operating income. We now expect our 2025 net interest expense to be approximately $20 million higher than 2024 due to the transition from convertible debt to traditional debt, which carries higher coupon rates and the extension of our interest rate swaps. For the year, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We also expect the 2025 ending balance of our diluted share count to be around $71 million, which is approximately 5% or 3.5 million shares lower than prior year due to the extinguishment of our convertible debt. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong free cash flow in 2025 compared to 2024 supported by robust growth and continued margin expansion. We anticipate a meaningful increase in capital expenditures during the fourth quarter as we invest strategically to enable long-term growth. As highlighted last quarter, we are actively assessing opportunities to accelerate our manufacturing expansion plans and look forward to sharing further updates at our upcoming Investor Day. Our team remains steadfast in its commitment to driving top-tier growth, expanding margins and increasing profitability and free cash flow. These efforts are central to our long-term value creation strategy and enable us to reach and serve more people with diabetes around the world. Finally, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the entire Insulet team for the warm welcome over the past month. Your dedication to our mission and your unwavering commitment to improving the lives of people with diabetes, inspire me every day. I'm excited to be part of this journey with you. With that, operator, please open the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the speakers available for Q&A today are Ashley McEvoy, Flavia Pease and Eric Benjamin. Our first question is from the line of Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.
Robert Marcus: Good morning and congrats on a great quarter, and welcome Flavia. I wanted to ask sort of a higher level question. Another great quarter, good -- record new patient growth, U.S., outside the U.S., 85% from MDI. [ Again ] double-digit new patient growth in Type 1 and Type 2 in the U.S. So clearly, Omnipod 5 appears to be winning, both U.S. and outside U.S. There's a lot more noise in the marketplace. A lot of people are talking about patch pumps. You're about to go from 2 public competitors to 3 public competitors and it seems like there's just a lot more noise out there, but you're coming above the crowd and delivering the best results. So maybe just walk us through where and how Omnipod 5 is winning? Is it just form factor? Is it the algorithm? Is it the easier onboarding? And really, just what's going on in the field? And what gives you the confidence you can continue to deliver great results like this.
Ashley McEvoy: Thanks, Robbie, for the question. I would just frame to say it's really broad-based, balanced growth, which really is showing that our strategy is working. It's really a combination of very strong, compelling science as evidenced by our SECURE-T2D trial, our RADIANT trial, as well as our very compelling real-world evidence. The second is we really do have this beloved brand. Customers love our differentiated form factor, and we're going to continue to stay ahead of the curve in that regard. Third really is around our differentiated access and affordability. Fourth is really, I would say, our supply chain. We've invested over $1 billion over the years to create a highly resilient supply chain that can scale at very competitive cost. We're producing millions of pods. And then I would say the last is just the flexibility of our balance sheet to be able to continue to invest in innovation to really -- to continue to stay as a market leader.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
David Roman: I wanted just to start on the Type 2s. You're about a year into having the indication for Type 2 in the U.S., I guess it was last August of '24. Can you talk a little bit more about how the adoption is built over the past year, where we are in kind of an uptake? And how we should think about that segment going forward? And maybe just perhaps related to that, you talked about DTC advertising as one of the big drivers here of SG&A growth in the quarter. Can you just maybe help pull the thread all the way through from that investment to new patient starts to revenue and maybe how that ties to the Type 2 adoption as well?
Ashley McEvoy: Yes, sure. Thank you, David. It's great to be a year into this. And I would say, like let me first start with, it's a very large TAM in the U.S. with Type 2. And I think that we're starting from a position of strength, which is really our 25 years of serving people with Type 1 diabetes. As you know, that there is a very similar call point there, starting with endos. And what we really saw in quarter 3 is echoed is that prescribers that are prescribing Type 1 for AID are also now prescribing Type 2. And not only is it giving birth to accelerated Type 2 adoption, it's also helping the prescribing behavior for Omnipod among the Type 1 community. We saw in Type 2 that our -- the prescriber base went up 26% in the quarter. Year-over-year NTS is up 100% and quarter-over-quarter was up 26%. And I would say it's really a combination of: one, strong science, as I first spoke about earlier. Two, it's around the leverage that we have invested with this call point on reputation and science. And three, we have activated some meaningful investment in DTC this past quarter, where we saw a very strong amount of leads from people who we do not call on. And we got -- we were able to kind of get those new colleagues on to pod. So I would say all three of those is what's giving us nice momentum 1 year into this launch of Type 2 with many years ahead.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Joanne Wuensch from Citigroup.
Joanne Wuensch: I too am going to go for a big picture question. It is rare that we see an entire new team from the CEO to the CFO to Investor Relations and just watching a company knock fall out. So I'm really curious what the 3 of you or 2 of you or collectively are planning to do differently to keep this momentum generally.
Ashley McEvoy: Well, listen, thank you, Joanne. I have to first say it's really a nice combination to see some very strong talent elevated, taking over more responsibility in the company. People like Amit Guliani, who is now our new Chief Technology Officer, people like Eric Benjamin, who spent nearly a decade at Insulet now assuming the post as Chief Operating Officer. And then obviously welcoming Flavia and some new capability with Manoj. I would describe it, Joanne, as the following. We have a remarkable technology. We sell on passion. We're going to sell more on science. We have invested ahead of the curve of our supply chain, which is giving us really scale affordability. And we now are the market leader, and we spent 25 years working on disrupting the market leader, we now are the market leader. So we are going to really start to continue to invest in things like market development and demand generation to create that endurable competitive moat going forward.
Flavia Pease: Yes. Joanne, just to add, as Ashley has said, even in her first 6 months, I think what all of us that are newer to the team inherent is a strategic and capital allocation strategy that are going to -- remain intact. We're just going to continue to build from a very strong foundation. And in my first 30 days, I've really been focusing on just continuing to understand those priorities, our innovation road map, our commercial plans and then the significant opportunities that we have to continue expanding penetration in this large market we operate in. And then going forward, how can I partner with the team to further activate levers that are going to allow us to continue delivering sustainable top-tier growth, expanding our margins and ensuring that we continue to execute with discipline and precision. So it's a really great time to be joining the Insulet team now in this new capacity and continue to improve the lives of people with diabetes and deliver shareholder value, so.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Travis Steed from Bank of America.
Travis Steed: Maybe I'll start with maybe just high level, some kind of puts and takes on '26 and how we should think about the year with Libre integration possibly and Type 2 accelerating. Can you continue to put up record new starts? And I wanted to also touch on the evaluate and refine our guidance practices. If you could elaborate on that, I think you said reflect the balanced outlook for the business and acknowledge potential risk. So I just wanted to make sure I elaborate on how you think about guidance going forward.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Travis. I'll start and I'll turn it to Flavia later. I would say clearly, we're really pleased with the momentum that we have in the U.S. and O.U.S., and we see a clear pathway to delivering continued top-tier growth, really backed by these proven leadership in these very large underpenetrated markets. And I think that we're confident in the strong growth and improved profitability when we expect that to continue in 2026. So we're going to provide '26 specific guidelines on our quarter 4 call. Consistent with historical practice. But I'll turn it over to Flavia to speak a little bit about your philosophy on guidance.
Flavia Pease: Yes. Thanks, Ashley. Travis. So obviously, we set guidance with the intent to deliver, and that is clearly not changing. I think what we will try to do as we continue to mature and evolve as an organization is trying to have a balanced view of our expectations, acknowledging that there are risks and uncertainties but also potential upside opportunities. So we are not changing how we guide other than ensuring that we have a balanced view going forward. I think we're also, as Clare and I continue to onboard and going forward into 2026, we look into what KPIs make the most sense to continue to provide as drivers of the performance of the business and help shareholders really understand our strategic direction. So we might evolve a little bit the metrics that we focus on and guide to, but more to come on that when we guide to 2026.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird.
Jeffrey Johnson: Ashley, I'm sure that you're going to get a lot of these questions here for the next year or 2. But just as we see 2-piece patch potential market entrances over the next 18 to 24 months or so, I'd love to hear kind of some early and I'm sure we'll get more at the Analyst Day, but kind of early thoughts you have on how you protect and maybe even extend your competitive moat there on the patch pump side.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Jeff. I would say, first of all, we really -- our key focus is about expanding the market and really taking people from MDI into the market, and we continue to lead the market. You'll hear more about this at Investor Day about kind of the performance, the percent of growth that Insulet has driven for the category has really been the majority, not a surprise. And so we want to continue to focus on our efforts of making AID accessible and available to as many patients as possible coming from MDI therapy. Now as you've heard us talk about, actually, this quarter, we did experience one of the strongest quarters in the past 2 years of sourcing also competitively. And I think that, that speaks to just the highly differentiated technology that Omnipod 5 is delivering for more customers around the world. I think it speaks to the investments we've been doing in making it a very frictionless customer experience from how we first make them aware of the product, whether that be through DTC or whether that be through their prescriber and then get them on pod and then keep them on pod. It's the investments, Jeff, that we're making in our pipeline that you're going to hear a lot more about in Investor Day. We spoke about in quarter 3, getting people, more people on phone control, going from 45% to 55%. We shared at the ADA real-world evidence, which showed that more people who are on phone control bolus more often. That's a really good thing for health outcomes. And you're going to see us continue to invest so that we are always staying ahead of the curve of demand on capacity investments and making sure that we continue to have a very diversified, very resilient supply chain that allows us to serve more Podders around the world.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Polark from Wolfe Research.
Michael Polark: I have a question on the outside United States performance, obviously, remarkably good. Now for 2 years running and it seems at this stage is set for this to continue into '26. I'm just -- I want to make sure models this year are kind of properly based as we go into next. Is there anything on the volume side as you roll out O5 and convert from DASH. I hear the price and mix stuff, but on volume kind of first fill dynamics, distributor stocking, these were positive influences called out as O5 rolled out in the U.S., I haven't heard anything about this O.U.S. Anything for us to keep in mind as we move into the next couple of years internationally?
Ashley McEvoy: Yes. Let me just start, Mike, and I'll turn to Flavia. I would say we have very robust durable growth in O.U.S. performance. And what we're seeing are the conversion, I would say, the upgrades of turning some of our DASH markets into Omnipod 5 markets. And we are benefiting some price materialization, but also a very accelerated volume uptick. And that's what's really enabling this business and internationally to post performance to like 40% and to have some of our NGS looking at 68% growth. I'll turn it over to Flavia.
Flavia Pease: Yes, Michael. So to your specific question, there is no material or immaterial, for that matter, impact of distributor stocking in the quarter or over the last several quarters. To Ashley's point, the growth internationally really has been primarily driven by volume. There is a bit of price/mix realization as you pointed out, as we continue to upgrade from DASH to Omnipod 5. And we are also not -- we still have headroom to go on that conversion. But again, the primary driver is volume, and there's no noise on stocking.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
Gursimran Kaur: This is Simran on for Larry. I guess I just wanted to focus a little bit more on U.S. Omnipod. Obviously, a really strong quarter, and it looks like you raised your guidance by more than double the beat. What exactly is driving the upside to U.S. expectations from kind of how you were guiding previously. And I guess, should we kind of continue to think about U.S. new starts on a quarterly basis being record new starts here moving forward. And just a little bit more about how should we think about sort of sustainability of some of those underlying trends that you're seeing in the U.S. business going forward?
Ashley McEvoy: Yes. Thank you for the question. Again, I'm going to say it's really a combination of both. Our core business, which has been Type 1 in the U.S., which is the site being in this business for 25 years, the penetration is still 40%. We still have a lot of upside. And we still have a lot of -- still clinical inertia that behavior of clinical prescribing behavior is not matching the ADI standard of care guidelines, which is to recommend AID therapy at the point of diagnosis. So we are going to continue to educate in that regard, and we have been doing that specifically in quarter 3, and we're seeing uptick of increased prescribing behavior. In addition to that, we -- obviously, it's Type 2. We've been at this for over -- for a year. Unbelievably low penetration rates, less than mid-single digit and with a lot of upside. And we are taking the science to the street is what I call, which is really about educating predominantly endocrinologists first, as well as high-prescribing PCPs on the science and the state of science and adoption of care. And really arming our field to go educate in that regard, doing a lot of peer-to-peer education of AID evangelist, if you will, and making sure that they can help with adoption in the Type 2 community. And then you also heard us talk about activating directly with consumers to make them aware that if they are someone with Type 2 diabetes, they should be seeking out a prescriber and asking them about Omnipod. And that has resulted in very meaningful lead in quarter 3. So it's very balanced on continuing to get strong performance from our core as well as getting really accelerated momentum with our new indication and our new customer base of people with Type 2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor from Jefferies.
Unknown Analyst: All right. This is [ Matt ] on for Matt Taylor. I just wanted to ask maybe one specific question on kind of contracting in the pharmacy channel. So as you see kind of more competition come in there, would you characterize any differences in your contracting dynamics that is anything on price or tenor?
Ashley McEvoy: Matt, thank you for the question. I would -- the short answer to that is, no. I would say that we've been at this for almost 8, 9 years of really kind of leading the pay-as-you-go business model in the pharmacy. Not only where people can pick up their insulin in about 47,000 pharmacies but equally with payers around taking the very strong health economic story and clinical outcome story to payers that has really enabled us to procure 300 million lives out of 317 million available lives and the majority of those at a preferred status. And so we -- for the majority, it translates to about $1 a day. And we're also working with a lot of our patients who have the government as some of their payers to make sure that they have good affordability and access. So I would say right now, we're really focusing our efforts on the very few minority where they are getting stuck, if you will, on prior authorities to really streamline that approval process. We've seen a meaningful uptick in our ability to -- in essence, get that need from 75% getting prior office through with like 90% completion rate. Again, that's the minority because we -- the majority, we have preferred status and you do not need a prior auth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter from Truist Securities.
Felipe Lamar: This is Felipe on for Rich. Just on converting Type 2 patients, could you just talk about how maybe the customer acquisition cost compares to that of Type 1? And just maybe how your scale could give you an advantage over the long-term in converting that patient population considering how early we are in adoption stages.
Ashley McEvoy: Yes. Thank you. And I would just say it's a great question, we're always looking at. We're not going to share that with us with you all the time, but we do look at the cost to acquire and the cost to serve and the lifetime value of our customer base. And the person who is leading all that work is Eric Benjamin. So Eric, why don't you talk about that?
Eric Benjamin: Thanks for the question. And just a little bit of color. As Ashley described earlier, we have the advantage of having a common call point that we've been in for 25 years as we've built the Type 1 business. And those are folks who are already prescribing AID for Type 1 who are familiar with technology, and so it's a really strong commercial synergy to be able to bring the SECURE-T2D data to that call point and help turn that existing call point already come full of technology into advocates and believers in AID for Type 2. And that's been a big part of our initial launch strategy is activating our current call point, which has high commercial synergies and is really efficient. We still have opportunity there. So we've had nice success activating that call point, we have more to go. So Richard, there's some -- there's a good tailwind there that we're building on. In addition, we're activating new prescribers. And obviously, we watch those efficiency metrics closely. In the early days as we're getting folks to start-up that is a higher cost, it takes some time to educate new providers on the benefits of Omnipod and how technology works. We've gotten good at it and folks know that Omnipod is easy to write, and we see high interest from new writers when our team enters new accounts to get them ramped. So as we're expanding the call point, we're doing that effectively and efficiently with a close eye on overall customer acquisition cost.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel.
Jonathan Block: Actually, maybe a little bit high level, but I'm just curious, DTC driving solid leads, spoke favorably to that and type 2 in the quarter already surpassing 35% of U.S. new starts. So at a high level, like any refined thoughts on where pump penetration can go within the T2II segment of the market? Just based on what you're seeing to date, would love to hear your thoughts.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Jon. And we hope you're coming to our Investor Day on November 20 in Acton, because we have been long waiting kind of share our story, if you will, of what we think our growth algorithm is and what our pipeline looks like and showcase our talent and really our steely determination to go serve more Podders. I would say a couple of things around Type 2. I mean it is a very large underpenetrated market in the U.S. It is globally as well. Right now, we're indicated for the U.S. And as Eric mentioned, I think our approach is differentiated versus maybe what some other offerings may be happening in the marketplace. And that really is around first starting with the equity that we've made with the call base over the past 25 years with Type 1 diabetes. And there's beautiful synergistic value that we've earned over 25 years, and we're going to parlay that into -- for the people with the Type 2 community. Interestingly enough endos write more scripts for people with Type 2 diabetes than they are for their Type 1 for AID therapy in the U.S. of what we're experiencing. And so I think we're going to couple that with continuing to invest in the science and continuing to invest in innovation and making it a frictionless experience. And then continue to invest in the supply chain. And last is kind of activating using the power of brand to make AID therapy seem less scary, if you will, of activating our DTC efforts, which really activates consumers to go ask for Omnipod specifically.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy from UBS.
Danielle Antalffy: Congrats on a good quarter there. And sorry about that, Eric. It's not often you get to say good morning, ladies as a group. So I couldn't resist. But just a question following up on the Type 2 versus Type 1, but more around endos versus primary care. And Eric, I was just curious if maybe you could talk a little bit about the difference in the go-to-market strategy, number one, between the two? And then number two, though, maybe more relevant how you guys think you are positioned right now within primary care? How much runway is there still to go to get some of these doctors online and prescribing?
Eric Benjamin: Danielle, thanks for the question. So a couple of things. It is two different calls that our team makes as you described. So we've been in the specialty call point for 25 years. Those folks know about technology. They know how to write technology. And so there, we're selling science. We're selling the benefits of Omnipod, and we're selling the fact that we're the #1 prescribed product that should be first line for folks who are considering AID and that message resonates. As we go beyond, so we expanded the sales force very actively earlier this year to call on another decile of primary care providers this year and that was effective. And as we make those calls and expand the call point, it's an activation. So it's a nurture call where we're introducing technology often to offices that haven't prescribed AID before. We're very thoughtful about going into places that have high opportunities, so they see and treat a lot of diabetes. And Omnipod is as strong proven outcomes, is easy to use, is differentiated. And our team can assess pretty quickly whether it's an office that's ready to become a regular AID writer or whether we just go activate a patient, for example, who may have been interested in technology from DTC on more of a one-off basis. So we're very selective about that to make sure that we're making the commercial investments and building the relationships that will turn into long-term writers, but we also make sure that we have DTC leads that we can serve those patients effectively. The bottom line is we see a lot of runway to be able to do that effectively as we keep ramping our commercial strength in the market and the team is executing really well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from Piper Sandler.
Matthew O'Brien: Welcome Flavia. The commentary about your highest competitive conversion rate in years was interesting to me. Is that a global comment? Or is that just domestic focused? And if it is global, can you just talk a little bit more about what's really driving that? I mean what's new? I know Omnipod 5 was great, but the sudden acceleration in terms of competitive conversions is kind of unique versus what you've been doing and what you've been seeing. So any commentary there would be very helpful.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you, Matthew. I'll start and maybe turn to Eric. That is a U.S. number, just to clarify, and I would say, while we've been in the U.S. with Omnipod 5 for coming up on 3 years and we weren't the first AID. I think what we're seeing is the highly differentiated form factor that customers love. We hear that again and again from all of our Pod community. We hear, I would say, the comfort level that prescribers are getting with Omnipod 5 performance backed by very strong evidence. So the SECURE-T2D, as well as the RADIANT, as well as real-world evidence is showing that it works. It reduces A1c, it improves time and range. It prevents lows. It doesn't promote weight gain. In fact, you have to use less insulin. That's a very compelling value proposition. And then coupled with the, I would say, very differentiated access and affordability of really pioneering the pay-as-you-go business model in pharmacy where people pick up their insulin and really working with payers to demonstrate our health economics and clinical outcomes to go get preferred status. That really is driving increased adoption. And it's really enabling Omnipod 5 to be the preferred AID of choice, and that's what's enabling our market leadership now for Type 1, but also the Type 2 indication. And so I still think we're very, very early innings of this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic of Canaccord.
William Plovanic: It's really -- I wanted to go back to the DTC marketing you outlined actually. And I think I heard a discussion on both the digital and the mass media and then also I'm kind of curious, there was some commentary regarding the prescribers and the patients. So -- and I wanted you to kind of -- if I heard that right, and if any color there would be appreciated.
Ashley McEvoy: Thanks, Bill. I'm going to turn it to Eric to talk about DTC.
Eric Benjamin: Bill, it's Eric. So Bill, when we do demand generation three things happen that all work together. The first is we've built a proven demand generation engine where we can produce leads, so interested qualified customers who are interested in Omnipod. That's effective. The two things that we also described are those folks then show up in physician offices and health care providers really appreciate a motivated customer asking about technology. We're creating a new market here, especially in Type 2, where there is some skepticism in the market about whether folks who live with Type 2 diabetes are ready for technology. And so when an activated lead walks into a health care provider office and asks for Omnipod, it's either that conversation for the health care provider and helps the health care providers see that technology is good for that population. So we see that, too. And finally, we had about 65% of the leads that we generated in the quarter are actually from customers that were cared for by folks with whom we don't have a direct sales relationship. And so those become warm invitations for our team to go have a conversation with those health care providers and assess might they be good prescribers of Omnipod for the future. So those are the three things happening with our demand generation DTC efforts.
Operator: This concludes our Q&A section. I would like to turn the conference back to Ashley McEvoy.
Ashley McEvoy: Thank you for joining. And I just wanted to also just thank the Insulet team. It's been a very strong quarter, and I'm very proud of how they continue to serve many more Podders around the world, and thank you for joining.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

Notes on direction and trends (prioritizing recent quarters):
- Revenue growth trend: 2025-Q3 shows acceleration vs 2024-Q3 across total revenue (28% vs 25%), total Omnipod (29% vs 26%), and international Omnipod (≈40% cc vs 35%).
- Margin trend: gross margin improved materially (72.2% vs 69.3%), operating margin improved (17.1% vs 16.2%), supporting better bottom-line operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA margin slipped slightly versus 2024-Q3 (22.7% vs 23.2%).
- U.S. Omnipod: 25.6% in 2025-Q3 is an improvement over the comparable 2024-Q3 (23%) and generally consistent with other recent quarters (near mid-20s).

Explicit higher / lower / similar statements (vs the most recent comparable quarter, 2024-Q3):
- Total revenue growth: 2025-Q3 is higher (28% > 25%).
- Total Omnipod growth: 2025-Q3 is higher (29% > 26%).
- U.S. Omnipod growth: 2025-Q3 is higher (25.6% > 23%).
- International Omnipod growth: 2025-Q3 is higher (39.9% cc > 35%).
- Gross margin: 2025-Q3 is higher (72.2% > 69.3%).
- Operating margin: 2025-Q3 is higher (17.1% > 16.2%).
- Adjusted EBITDA margin: 2025-Q3 is slightly lower (22.7% < 23.2%).

2) Supported outcomes — management commentary confirmed by numbers (focus on bottom-line performance)
- Management claimed margin expansion and stronger bottom-line leverage; confirmed:
  - Gross margin expanded 290 bps YoY to 72.2% (explicit confirmation of improved product-level profitability).
  - Operating margin expanded 90 bps YoY to 17.1% (confirms improved operating leverage and supports bottom-line improvement).
  - Management stated manufacturing ramps in Acton and Malaysia are delivering improved margins — the material gross-margin and operating-margin expansions support that claim.
- Management raised full-year gross-margin and operating-margin outlooks (gross margin >71%; operating margin guidance 17.3–17.5%). The Q3 gross margin at 72.2% exceeds the >71% guidance and Q3 operating margin (17.1%) is close to the raised full-year operating-margin range, supporting the decision to raise guidance.
- Management highlighted international momentum and FX tailwinds; confirmed by reported international growth (46.5% reported / 39.9% cc) and a reported total-growth boost from FX (~170 bps) for the quarter.
- Net-income-specific note: management did not provide a single quarter net income figure in the supplied facts, but the combination of stronger revenue growth, +290 bps gross margin, and +90 bps operating margin constitutes evidence of improved bottom-line operating profitability versus the comparable prior quarter (2024-Q3). Adjusted EBITDA margin slightly below prior-quarter level (22.7% vs 23.2%) is an exception to the generally improved bottom-line operating story and should be watched.

- 當前 (2025-Q3) — 總營收與匯率: "Total revenues of over $700 million, an increase of 28% at constant currency rates and 30% at reported rates. Foreign currency contributed 170 basis points to third quarter reported growth."
  - 過往: 提供過往季度未有完全相同的 FX 貢獻數字，但 2024-Q3 成長 (25%) 低於 2025-Q3 報導之 30%。
  - 比較: 2025-Q3 報導成長 (30%) 超過 2024-Q3 (25%)；匯率大約貢獻了 170 bps 的增勢。

趨勢要點（優先近期季度）：
- 營收成長：2025-Q3 較 2024-Q3 在總營收 (28% vs 25%)、總 Omnipod (29% vs 26%)、以及國際 Omnipod (≈40% cc vs 35%) 全面加速。
- 利潤率：毛利率大幅提升 (72.2% vs 69.3%)，營業利潤也提升 (17.1% vs 16.2%)，顯示經營槓桿改善，有利於底線。惟經調整 EBITDA 利潤率略微下滑 (22.7% vs 23.2%)，為例外情況。
- 美國市場：25.6%（2025-Q3）高於 2024-Q3（23%），大致維持在近幾季中位數（中 20%）。

明確較高/較低/相近陳述（相對最接近的可比季 2024-Q3）：
- 總營收成長：較高（28% > 25%）。
- 總 Omnipod 成長：較高（29% > 26%）。
- 美國 Omnipod 成長：較高（25.6% > 23%）。
- 國際 Omnipod 成長：較高（39.9% cc > 35%）。
- 毛利率：較高（72.2% > 69.3%）。
- 營業利潤：較高（17.1% > 16.2%）。
- 經調整 EBITDA 利潤率：略低（22.7% < 23.2%）。

2) 支援性結果 — 管理層明確指出的歷史比較已被數字證實（聚焦底線表現）
- 管理層宣稱利潤率擴張與改善底線槓桿；數字證實：
  - 毛利率年增 290 bps 至 72.2%（明確證實產品層級獲利改善）。
  - 營業利潤年增 90 bps 至 17.1%（確認營運槓桿改善並支持底線提升）。
  - 管理層提到 Acton 與馬來西亞製造產線超前計畫並改善利潤；毛利與營業利潤的實際擴張支持該說法。
- 管理層上調全年毛利與營業利潤展望（毛利 >71%；營業利潤 17.3–17.5%）；Q3 毛利 72.2% 超過 >71% 的導引，Q3 營業利潤 17.1% 亦接近上調後全年範圍，支持上調決定。
- 管理層強調國際動能與匯率助益；數字確認國際成長（46.5% 報導 / 39.9% cc）及本季報導成長中匯率貢獻約 170 bps。
- 關於淨利：供給的事項未直接揭露單季淨利數，但營收加速、毛利 +290 bps 與營業利潤 +90 bps 一併構成改善底線營運獲利的實證。唯一需留意的是經調整 EBITDA 利潤率較 2024-Q3 略低（22.7% vs 23.2%），是底線改善路徑上的小幅例外，應持續監控。

Peers note:
English

- Fact 1 — Q3 2025 total revenue
  - PODD: Emphasizes a milestone — "surpassed $700 million" and 28% YoY growth (constant currency).
  - Other firms: Comparable commentary focuses on much larger absolute revenue milestones or different growth magnitudes (e.g., "nearly $1.3 billion" for HOOD Q3 2025 or $1.055 billion for AKAM Q3 2025), highlighting absolute scale differences rather than the milestone framing PODD uses (HOOD Q3 2025; AKAM Q3 2025).

- Fact 2 — Q3 2025 operating margin
  - PODD: Highlights margin expansion of 90 bps to 17.1%, framing as operational improvement.
  - Other firms: Peers report a wide range of operating margins (from single‑digit to very high: e.g., 7.83% HSIC Q3 2025, 19.1% CRL Q1 2025, 51% PLTR Q3 2025); their commentary often emphasizes relative improvement or much higher absolute margins, showing PODD focuses on steady, mid‑teens improvement versus peers' diverse margin profiles (HSIC Q3 2025; CRL Q1 2025; PLTR Q3 2025).

- Fact 3 — International revenue growth
  - PODD: Attributes 40% constant‑currency international growth to Omnipod 5 rollout.
  - Other firms: Peers often point to product rollout or market expansion too (e.g., DXCM references coverage expansion driving reach), but some peers report different magnitudes or different drivers; the comparable comments emphasize market access and PBM coverage whereas PODD ties growth specifically to Omnipod 5 rollout (DXCM 2025‑Q3).

- Fact 5 — Q3 2025 Omnipod revenue growth
  - PODD: Reports total Omnipod grew 29% YoY (constant currency).
  - Other firms: Comparable firms’ growth statements vary widely and often highlight larger or smaller percentages in different product lines; PODD frames growth around a specific product family (Omnipod) and constant‑currency basis, whereas peers' examples show differing product mixes and reporting conventions (e.g., MPWR and ABNB revenue quarters used as absolute comparisons).

- Fact 6 — Q3 2025 U.S. Omnipod revenue growth
  - PODD: States U.S. Omnipod grew 25.6%, noting it exceeded guidance.
  - Other firms: Peers typically report growth versus guidance or prior periods but with different contexts and magnitudes; PODD emphasizes outperforming its guidance, while peer excerpts focus on record revenues or different guidance comparisons (MPWR Q2 2025; various).

- Fact 7 — Q3 2025 international Omnipod revenue
  - PODD: Gives detailed reported (46.5%) and constant‑currency (39.9%) growth and reports international revenues crossed $200 million.
  - Other firms: Peers generally report single aggregate growth figures or absolute revenue; PODD provides both reported and constant‑currency rates plus an absolute milestone, a more granular disclosure than many peers (AKAM Q3 2025; DXCM 2025‑Q3).

- Fact 8 — Q3 2025 gross margin
  - PODD: Reports gross margin at 72.2%, up 290 bps YoY.
  - Other firms: Some peers report much lower gross margins or different YoY moves (e.g., WST Q2 2025 pro forma 35.7% with a 290 bps increase; ALGN Q3 2024 ~69.7%); PODD's gross margin is positioned at the high end relative to many peers and the commentary highlights both level and YoY expansion (WST 2025‑Q2; ALGN 2024‑Q3).

- Fact 9 — Q3 2025 adjusted operating and EBITDA margins
  - PODD: Adjusted operating margin 17.1% and adjusted EBITDA margin 22.7%.
  - Other firms: Peer adjusted EBITDA margin ranges cited vary (e.g., XYL expected 21.7%–22.2% for Q3 adj. EBITDA margin), showing PODD's EBITDA margin is comparable to some peers but PODD pairs it with product/margin drivers in the call (XYL Q2 2025).

- Fact 14 — Q3 2025 total revenue and FX impact
  - PODD: Reports 28% CC growth, 30% reported, with FX contributing 170 bps.
  - Other firms: Peers give FX impacts or FX‑neutral growth guidance (e.g., EBAY expected revenue implying FX‑neutral growth; AKAM noted a $3m FX impact), but PODD quantifies both CC vs reported and explicit bps contribution, a more explicit FX disclosure than many comparables (EBAY 2025‑Q2; AKAM 2025‑Q2).

- Fact 18 — R&D spending growth
  - PODD: R&D up 41%, +80 bps of sales.
  - Other firms: Peers report varying R&D growth (e.g., DDOG R&D up 30% YoY; ANET reported $164.6m R&D), but PODD emphasizes a large percentage increase and impact on sales percentage, signaling aggressive investment versus some peers that present more moderate R&D changes (DDOG 2025‑Q2; ANET 2024‑Q1).

- Fact 25 — Manufacturing ramp and margins
  - PODD: States facilities (Acton, Malaysia) are "ramping ahead of plan," improving customer service and margins.
  - Other firms: Peers reference capacity or margin benefits but with varied timing/scale—examples include claims of "ahead of schedule" capacity improvements or expected margin benefits over 6–12 months (COO 2025‑Q1; WST 2024‑Q3). PODD combines operational ramp commentary with immediate margin improvement claims versus peers that often project future improvement windows.

- Fact 27 — Pharmacy access footprint and coverage
  - PODD: Notes availability in >47,000 U.S. pharmacies and coverage by >90% of commercial plans, reaching >300 million lives.
  - Other firms: Peers (DXCM, CVS) emphasize coverage counts differently (e.g., "coverage established for nearly 6 million type 2 non‑insulin lives" or pharmacy services membership ~90 million). PODD stresses broad pharmacy footprint and a massive "lives reached" metric, framing reach more broadly than peer coverage examples (DXCM 2025‑Q3; CVS 2024‑Q3).

- Fact 29 — Type 2 prescriber growth percentages
  - PODD: Prescriber base up 26% in the quarter; NTS up 100% YoY and 26% QoQ.
  - Other firms: Peers discuss prescriber or patient starts in absolute terms (e.g., DXCM citing "more than 50,000" prescribers added or "record new customer starts"); PODD emphasizes percentage growth in both prescribers and starts, showing rapid percentage acceleration rather than absolute additions (DXCM 2024‑Q4; DXCM 2025‑Q1).

- Fact 15 & 21 — New customer starts (NCS) trends & U.S. Type 2 NCS growth
  - PODD: Reports YoY and sequential growth across U.S. Type 1/2 and International Type 1, with record total new customer starts; Type 2 NCS more than doubled YoY.
  - Other firms: Comparable commentary (DXCM) also highlights record or hundreds of thousands of patient starts, but peers sometimes note temporary quality challenges or different drivers; PODD frames broad, cross‑segment NCS strength and record levels, aligning with peers but stressing sustained multi‑segment improvement (DXCM 2025‑Q1; DXCM 2025‑Q3).

- Fact 23 — International Omnipod demand
  - PODD: "Robust growth" — 40% YoY CC from Omnipod 5 rollout.
  - Other firms: Peers often link international growth to coverage/market access or staged rollouts; PODD ties the demand explicitly to product rollout performance and quantifies it, while peer comments sometimes highlight broader coverage milestones (DXCM 2025‑Q3).

- Fact 32 — Discussion of Q4 and full‑year 2025 outlook
  - PODD: Announces it will discuss Q4 and full‑year 2025 outlook on the call.
  - Other firms: Peers also announce or provide forward guidance timing (e.g., META Q4 2024 guidance on earnings calls); PODD follows standard practice, with no notable deviation in approach versus comparables (META 2024‑Q3).

- Fact 33 — Libre 3 integration timing (U.S.)
  - PODD: Targets first half of 2026 for Libre 3 integration as a top priority.
  - Other firms: Peer references place similar timelines for launches or integration in "first half of 2026" or "ready in 2026" (APP 2025‑Q2; LKQ 2025‑Q2). PODD aligns with peer timing statements, emphasizing prioritization of the integration (APP 2025‑Q2).

- Fact 34 — Dexcom 15‑day sensor integration
  - PODD: Commits to launch when Dexcom launches ("When Dexcom launches, so will we").
  - Other firms: Dexcom and peers discuss synchronized launches and second‑half timing for the 15‑day sensor (DXCM 2025‑Q1). PODD's stance mirrors peer coordination language, emphasizing tight alignment with partner timing (DXCM 2025‑Q1).

- Fact 35 — Additional Omnipod 5 rollouts in 2026
  - PODD: States more rollouts planned in 2026 present significant international growth opportunities.
  - Other firms: Peers discuss future rollouts and market expansion for 2026 (e.g., APP and DASH referencing 2026 commercialization/readiness); PODD explicitly connects rollouts to near‑term international growth potential, consistent with peer rollout narratives (APP 2025‑Q2; DASH 2025‑Q3).

- Fact 38 — Capacity expansion investments
  - PODD: Accelerating investments to increase facility capacity to support growth.
  - Other firms: Peers similarly describe capacity investments and timing (e.g., DASH "several hundred millions of incremental investments for 2026"; COO "ahead of schedule"); PODD emphasizes acceleration and linkage to immediate capacity needs, consistent with peer emphasis but tied to specific facilities (DASH 2025‑Q3; COO 2025‑Q1).

- Fact 39 & 41 — Q4 2025 Omnipod and total company revenue growth guidance; U.S./International Q4 guidance
  - PODD: Provides explicit Q4 ranges: Omnipod 27%–30%, company 25%–28%; U.S. Omnipod 24%–27%, International 37%–40%.
  - Other firms: Peers provide full‑year or quarterly guidance with varied ranges and midpoints (e.g., AXON ~25% annual growth implied, EPAM 13%–15%); PODD gives product‑level and region‑level ranges, offering more granular near‑term guidance than many comparables that often give company‑level ranges (AXON 2024‑Q4; EPAM 2025‑Q2).

- Fact 43, 44, 46, 48 — Raised full‑year 2025 guidance (Omnipod, company, U.S., International) and FX assumption
  - PODD: Raised full‑year Omnipod to 29%–30%, company to 28%–29%, U.S. Omnipod to 26%–27%, International to 38%–39%; expects ~500 bps favorable FX for international reported basis.
  - Other firms: Peers similarly revise guidance based on performance but with different levels (e.g., EPAM 13%–15% FY guidance; many peers report operating margin outlooks rather than the same revenue lifts). PODD's update is notable for raising product and regional guidance concurrently and explicitly quantifying FX benefit (EPAM 2025‑Q2; AKAM FX notes 2025‑Q2).

- Fact 50 — 2025 gross margin outlook
  - PODD: Now expects full‑year gross margin >71% (up from ~71%).
  - Other firms: Peers' gross margin expectations differ widely (e.g., NTAP roughly 70% FY24 guidance; GNRC ~39.5% for 2025), but PODD's expected gross margin (>71%) is high relative to many comparables and the commentary stresses upward revision based on YTD performance (NTAP 2024‑Q1; GNRC 2025‑Q2).

- Fact 51 — 2025 operating margin outlook
  - PODD: Now expects operating margin 17.3%–17.5%, representing 240–260 bps YoY improvement.
  - Other firms: Peers' operating margin outlooks vary (e.g., IDXX 31.6%–31.8% for 2025; ANET historical ranges). PODD's projected mid‑teens operating margin and explicit YoY bps improvement are more conservative in absolute level than some peer outlooks but presented as meaningful improvement for the company (IDXX 2025‑Q3).

- Fact 55 — 2025 free cash flow
  - PODD: Expresses confidence in delivering "strong free cash flow in 2025 compared to 2024" supported by growth and margin expansion.
  - Other firms: Peers give numeric FCF targets or ranges (e.g., FISV $5.5bn anticipated, HII $300m–$500m range). PODD provides qualitative confidence rather than a specific dollar or range in this call, contrasting with peers who often provide explicit FCF guidance (FISV 2025‑Q1; HII 2024‑Q4).

- Fact 56 — Capex plans
  - PODD: Anticipates a "meaningful increase" in CapEx in Q4 to invest for long‑term growth.
  - Other firms: Peers commonly give numeric CapEx ranges (e.g., ULTA $400m–$450m planned CapEx; LYV $900m for 2025), whereas PODD gives directional commentary without a dollar range in the call (ULTA 2024‑Q2; LYV 2024‑Q4).

- 事實 1 — 2025 年第 3 季總營收
  - PODD：強調里程碑 —「季度營收首次超過 7 億美元」，並在不計匯率情況下年增 28%。
  - 其他公司：可比公司關注的多為更大絕對營收或不同成長幅度（例如 HOOD Q3 2025「nearly $1.3 billion」、AKAM Q3 2025「$1.055 billion」），它們傾向以規模為重，而 PODD 以里程碑式的表述為主（HOOD Q3 2025；AKAM Q3 2025）。

- 事實 2 — 2025 年第 3 季營業利潤率
  - PODD：強調營業利潤率擴張 90 個基點至 17.1%，呈現經營改善。

- 事實 3 — 國際營收成長
  - PODD：將 40% YoY（不計匯率）國際成長歸因於 Omnipod 5 推展。
  - 其他公司：同業也會將成長歸於產品上線或市場擴展（如 DXCM 強調覆蓋擴大），但可比者更常談 PBM 覆蓋與市場所及，PODD 更直接將成長與特定產品推出連結（DXCM 2025‑Q3）。

- 事實 5 — 2025 年第 3 季 Omnipod 營收成長
  - PODD：報告總 Omnipod 年增 29%（不計匯率）。

  - PODD：開方基數季增 26%；NTS 年增 100%、季增 26%。
  - 其他公司：同業常以絕對人數（如 DXCM 提到新增 >50,000 開方人）或「record starts」，PODD 倚重百分比成長來呈現加速趨勢，而同業則有時以絕對規模說明影響範圍（DXCM 2024‑Q4；DXCM 2025‑Q1）。

- 事實 15 & 21 — 新客戶啟用 (NCS) 趨勢 & 美國第 2 型 NCS 成長

- 事實 55 — 2025 年自由現金流
  - PODD：對 2025 年相較 2024 年能交出「強勁的自由現金流」表達信心，理由是成長與邊際擴張。

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).

---

Respond in **exactly** this format in English:

<Couple of sentences of Explanation in English, including tone classification and key up/down drivers>

**Summary: <Two sentences supporting your verdict with facts and evidence>, Direction : <0-10>**

Bilingual requirement:
- First, produce the full output in **English** exactly following the format specified above, including the final "Direction" line.
- After you have produced the English output, append a second section where you
  translate the entire explanation (but not the numeric score) into Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), preserving the same reasoning and structure.
- Do NOT modify the English output or its format; the Chinese section must come AFTER the English output.

ORIGINAL EARNINGS CALL TRANSCRIPT:
---
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Hall, Senior Director of Finance. Please go ahead.
Andrew Hall: Good afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates, or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.'s current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.'s annual report on Form 10-Ks, other reports, and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Shelley Simpson, our CFO, Brad Delco, Spencer Frazier, EVP of Sales and Marketing, our COO and President of Highway Services and Final Mile, Nick Hobbs, Brad Hicks, President of Dedicated Contract Services, and Darren Field, President of Intermodal. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?
Shelley Simpson: Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon. Throughout the year, our focus has been on three clear priorities: operational excellence, scaling into our investments, and continuing to repair our margins to drive stronger financial performance. We are executing these priorities with discipline and determination, guided by a strategy designed to strengthen our competitive position and unlock long-term value for our shareholders. I am highly confident that our approach is building a stronger company, one that is fully equipped to capitalize on meaningful growth opportunities ahead while driving stronger financial performance. Across our businesses, service levels remain excellent. We have systemically elevated our service standards to drive disciplined profitable growth with both new and existing customers. Even as overall freight demand softened during the quarter, our unwavering commitment to service enabled our intermodal and highway businesses to capture additional volume and outperform the market. Operational excellence is now synonymous with J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and we are leveraging this reputation to drive strategic growth and maximize returns on our investments to match the unique value and strong service levels we provide for customers. We remain focused on controlling what we can, optimizing costs in the near term without sacrificing our future earnings power potential. In addition, we are placing a heightened emphasis on operational efficiency throughout the organization. By streamlining processes, adopting best practices, and leveraging technology, we aim to utilize every resource as effectively as possible to maximize productivity and performance. Our initiative to lower our cost to serve, announced last quarter, is focused on removing structural costs from our business. The organization's collaborative efforts continue to gain momentum, and Brad will share more details on our progress. This initiative marks our latest evolution in expense discipline, and we are making good progress towards reaching our $100 million savings goal and advancing towards our long-term margin target. Now, let me address the elephant in the room: rail consolidation. J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.'s position is rooted in our commitment to delivering exceptional intermodal service and creating long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We recognize both the opportunities and risks that consolidation presents. But our decades of experience, including navigating seven prior Class I railroad mergers, and our thoughtfully developed long-term agreements and strong relationships with NS, CSX, and BNSF should provide the basis for us to adapt to any changes in the industry. As the largest domestic intermodal provider, our scale and influence allow us to coordinate complex intermodal moves and deliver unique solutions for our customers. We are consistently rated best in class by third-party industry surveys of intermodal customers. And our ability to deliver seamless, differentiated service across the entire North American intermodal network is a key competitive advantage. Our focus remains on providing reliable, efficient, and innovative service that benefits our customers now and into the future. As the rail industry evolves, we expect our proven adaptability and unwavering dedication to service will not only safeguard our leadership position but should also continuously set higher standards of excellence for our customers. I want to close by recognizing the entire organization for their hard work and progress across many areas of focus. The third quarter is extra special at J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. as it includes National Truck Driver and National Technician Appreciation Week. Our professional drivers and maintenance teams are the backbone of our success. And their record-breaking safety performance is a testament to their skill, dedication, and attention to safety every day. We appreciate all they do to keep our company, our customers, and our communities safe. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our newly appointed CFO, Brad Delco.
Brad Delco: Thanks, Shelley, and good afternoon. I will hit on some highlights of the quarter, review our capital allocation plan, and give an update on the lowering our cost to serve initiative. Let me start with the quarter. As you have already seen from our release, revenue was roughly flat year over year while operating income improved 8% and diluted earnings per share improved 18% versus the prior year period. While inflation in insurance, wages, and employee benefits and equipment costs were all up, our productivity and cost management efforts more than offset those headwinds to drive our improved results. Over the years, you have heard us talk about investing in our long-term growth, maintaining cost discipline without jeopardizing our future earnings power, and creating operating leverage when the market returns. Well, it's no secret the market hasn't returned yet, but the notable improvement in our financial performance this quarter should serve as a true testament to the talent and capabilities of the people throughout our organization and the execution of our strategy towards operational excellence in safety, service, and lowering our cost to serve. On capital allocation, our balance sheet remains healthy, maintaining leverage around our target of one times trailing twelve-month EBITDA while purchasing over $780 million or 5.4 million shares of our stock year to date. This aligns with our messaging around prefunding our long-term future growth during the downturn and having the flexibility with the strong cash flow generation of the business to be opportunistic with share repurchases as a way to return value to our shareholders. We will be disciplined in our capital allocation approach with investing in the business as priority number one, sustaining our investment-grade balance sheet, supporting future dividend growth, and finally continuing our opportunistic repurchases. Last quarter, we outlined our lowering our cost serve initiative to remove $100 million of structural costs from the business. I'm happy to share we are off to a good start, having eliminated greater than $20 million in the quarter. Examples of our success are in service efficiencies, balancing our networks, dynamically serving customers to meet their needs, focusing even more on discretionary spending, and driving greater asset utilization. We remain committed to updating you on our progress going forward. But our intent is to demonstrate our progress in our reported results rather than just speak to them. As we noted last quarter, we will realize a portion of these benefits this year, with the majority of the impact realized in 2026. Let me close with this and what I hope you take away from our quarter. First, our company continues to execute from a position of strength. We have been transparent with our strategy, our investments to be best prepared to service our customers' future capacity needs. Second, we also continue to remove structural costs from the business. We are off to a good start and have more work to do. Third, our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash, and we remain focused on generating strong returns with our deployed capital. We have been opportunistic with our share repurchases, all while maintaining modest leverage on our balance sheet. That concludes my remarks. Now I'd like to turn it over to Spencer.
Spencer Frazier: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our view of the market and some feedback we are hearing from our customers. Overall demand trended below normal seasonality for much of the quarter outside of the seasonal lift we saw at quarter-end. On the supply side, truckload capacity continued to exit the market, and the pace of exits is accelerating. But the soft demand environment is likely muting the market impact of capacity attrition. Outside of recent weeks, truckload spot rates remained under pressure in the quarter. More recent regulatory developments and, more importantly, regulatory enforcement is having an impact on capacity. While this industry may have a chicken little reputation when it comes to predicting capacity changes, the capacity bubble may be deflating as we speak. In the near term, customers will remain skeptical of any predicted change, only believing it when they experience it. Shifting to intermodal, volumes declined 1% year over year. We believe our volumes held up better relative to the broader truckload market decline, primarily because more customers are converting freight to intermodal from the highway as they see our commitment to operational excellence differentiating J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. Intermodal from the competition. The service we provide ranks us at the top of our customer scorecards, and we continue to be ranked at the top of industry surveys as well, with a Net Promoter Score of 53. When we go to market, we work with customers to dynamically solve their supply chain needs by designing and executing our operations to meet their requirements. For example, in our intermodal business, customers trust us to select the most efficient service regardless of the rail provider to seamlessly move their freight throughout North America. Today, roughly half of our interchange volume on transcontinental shipments occurs through a steel wheel interchange. This ratio can change dynamically and demonstrates our ability to be agile at scale to execute and meet our customer expectations. Regardless of how the rail landscape and operating scenarios might change over the next couple of years, we remain committed to delivering exceptional service and growing with our customers. Regarding the current peak season, the strong container volume into the West Coast in July generated headlines regarding a potential pull forward. Ocean peak season came early. That said, it is important to disconnect the timing of peak season on the water from the peak season of the inland supply chain. Our customers are still expecting a peak season, although the magnitude and duration of peak volumes will vary. Our conversations indicate there is a large amount of freight that was imported early that hasn't moved through the inland supply chain yet. No one has canceled Christmas. I'll close with some customer feedback. Our customers realize the financial health of the transportation industry is not great. And as a result, they are choosing to do more with the best carriers and more with fewer carriers. Shippers are focused on creating efficiencies in their supply chains by working with providers who are safe and financially sound and who execute with agility and predictability. Our scroll of services continues to operate from a position of strength, creating value as the go-to transportation provider for our customers. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick.
Nick Hobbs: Thanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our areas of focus across our operations, followed by an update on our Final Mile, truckload, and brokerage businesses. I'll start on our safety performance. Safety is a core piece of our culture and a key differentiator of our value proposition in the market. We are coming off of two consecutive years of record performance measured by DOT preventable accidents per million miles, and our safety results through the third quarter are performing even better than these record performances. This performance is a testament to our people and the attention to detail they bring to the job every day, as well as our focus on proper training and technology. Our safety performance is a key piece of driving out cost and will continue to be an area of focus. While the ultimate impact on industry capacity is hard to pinpoint, we believe the recent developments on regulations and enforcement, when taken together, could have a noticeable impact on available industry capacity. These include new regulations around English language proficiency, B1 Visas, FMCSA, biometric ID verification, and non-domiciled CDLs. Importantly, for J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., we do not expect to see any material impact on our capacity. There have been some signs based on what we are seeing in our truck and brokerage operations that it could have a broader industry impact. Moving to the business, let's start with the final mile. As we said last quarter, business conditions in our end markets remain challenged with soft demand for furniture, exercise equipment, and appliances. We continue to see positive demand in our fulfillment network driven by off-price retail. Going forward, we expect market conditions to remain challenged through at least year-end. Our focus remains on providing the highest service levels, being safe and secure, ensuring that the value we provide in the market is realized to drive appropriate returns. In 2026, we do anticipate losing some legacy appliance-related business, but we will be working diligently on backfilling with other brands and service offerings in this segment of our business. Moving to JBT, our focus in this business hasn't changed, and we are winning business with strong service from both new and existing customers, leading to our highest quarterly volume in over a decade. We are remaining disciplined with our growth to ensure our network remains balanced in order to drive the best utilization of our trailing assets. Going forward, we are pleased with the direction of this business in this soft demand environment and the progress we are making on lowering our cost to serve. We see an opportunity for further efficiency and automation gains in the future as we continue to leverage our 360 platform. That said, meaningful improvements in our profitability in this business will be driven by greater levels of rate improvement and overall demand for truckload drop trailing solutions. I'll close with ICS. During the third quarter, volumes modestly improved sequentially as new volume from recent bid wins was partially offset by soft demand in the overall truckload market. Truckload spot rates remained depressed throughout the quarter, but we saw gross margins remain healthy. We are almost through bid season and are pleased with the awards we have received, with rates up low to mid-single digits, winning volume with new customers. Our focus here remains on profitable growth with the right customers where we can differentiate ourselves with service. Going forward, we will remain focused on scaling into our while continuing to make improvements to our cost structure and leveraging our 360 platform to drive greater efficiency and automation, which will help lower our cost to serve. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hicks: Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon everybody. I'll provide an update on our dedicated results. Starting with the quarter, at a high level, our third quarter results were very strong, particularly in light of this challenging freight environment. We believe our results are a testament to the strength and diversification of our model, the value we create for our customers, and how we drive accountability at each site and customer location. As a result, we continue to see good demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions. During the third quarter, we sold approximately 280 trucks of new deals. As a reminder, our annual net sales target is for 800 to 1,000 new trucks per year, and we would be on pace with this target absent the known losses disclosed almost two years ago. Encouragingly, our overall sales pipeline remains strong as our value proposition in the market remains differentiated. Our sales cycle in dedicated is typically eighteen months from start to finish, and our pipeline includes both large and small fleets at various stages of completion, all underwritten to our return targets. Overall, I remain pleased with the momentum and activity in the pipeline. As I just mentioned and as we have communicated over the past eighteen months, we have had visibility to fleet losses that wrapped up in early July, which negatively impacted our third quarter '25 truck count by about 85 trucks versus our second quarter results. Navigating through these losses, in addition to call outs we've had related to some customer bankruptcies and the overall market dynamics, demonstrates our discipline and strong execution. While we were losing locations that had historically delivered mature margins, we were simultaneously absorbing startup costs from onboarding new business. Despite facing these two margin pressures, we still maintain double-digit margins during this period. I am extremely proud of all of our teams for their effort. Hope going forward, knowing that most of our fleet losses are behind us, is that we are back on track with our net fleet growth plan moving forward. We believe the performance of our dedicated business has been a standout not only for our company but also the industry. We have great visibility into the financial performance of each account, which provides a high level of accountability at each location and a diversified customer base with our managers on-site with our customers, which we believe creates unique value that is a differentiator for us. Going forward, with our known losses behind us, our expectation for modest fleet growth in 2025 has not changed. As we have said previously, when we sell new truck deals, and that business starts up, we do incur some expenses as that business is onboarded. That said, this isn't new for us. We are starting up new customer locations each quarter. Given our progress with respect to lowering our cost to serve, we expect our 2025 operating income to be approximately flat compared to 2024. The magnitude of any potential variance higher or lower to this outlook will be driven by the number of locations we start up during the quarter. We believe the setup is favorable for us to continue our growth trajectory in 2026 and beyond. Our business model and value proposition are differentiated in the market and continue to attract new customers. We remain confident in our ability to compound our growth over many years to further penetrate our large addressable market. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Darren.
Darren Field: Thank you, Brad. Thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'd like to start by saying I feel really good about our performance and how our strategy and solid execution drove meaningful improvements in our results. I believe this is a true testament to our focus on operational excellence, cost discipline, and progress on lowering our cost serve initiative. Before we get into more detail on the results, I want to follow up on some of Shelley's comments regarding the potential for Class I rail consolidation. First, there are still a lot of unknowns. But I am confident J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. should be a primary consideration and actively engaged in all discussions involving the future of the intermodal industry as well as the execution of all Class one's desire to take share from the highway to grow their intermodal service offering. We have offered seamless transcontinental intermodal services for decades, connecting BNSF with both Eastern railroads, and believe that opportunity could exist well into the future regardless of the various outcomes we know are either announced or speculated in the market. We continue to see a large opportunity to convert highway shipments to intermodal, and if the motivation for consolidation is to compete more with trucks, we believe this will present our industry-leading intermodal franchise additional growth opportunities. We are one of the largest purchasers of rail capacity in North America, and we will engage in discussions with all rail providers to execute on a strategy and plan that we think is in the best interest of our shareholders. Turning to the quarter, demand for our domestic intermodal service wasn't all that strong, but nonetheless, we saw sequential improvement in volumes and executed some of the most efficient dray service in our history, particularly in September. As Spencer mentioned, we still expect the peak season as lots of volume that moved on the water earlier this year will still need to advance in the inland supply chain ahead of the holidays. Volumes in the quarter were down 1% year over year and by month were down 3% in July, down 2% in August, and flat in September. After seeing unique strength off the West Coast last year due to the threat of the East Coast port labor disruption, TransCon volumes were down percent in the quarter, while Eastern loads were up 6%. As we've communicated all year, we had a bid season strategy focused on getting better balance in our network to grow volumes and repair our margins with more price, particularly in our headhaul lanes. Last quarter, we talked about our success in the bid season, particularly around balance, and we think that success combined with our lowering our cost to serve initiatives were key contributors to our year-over-year and sequential performance improvement. Our service performance remains strong. Our primary rail providers BNSF, NS, and CSX continue to deliver excellent service, which we believe is taking share from Highway. I am confident our service offering is being recognized in the market. Customers are reengaging with us with additional opportunities largely driven by our differentiated service and value compared to both highway and IMCs. As you all are keenly aware, we have the capacity and ability to execute on a meaningful growth plan over the coming years based on investments we've already made. In closing, we remain very confident in our intermodal franchise and the value we provide for our customers. We have shown the ability to grow and generate strong returns through many rail consolidation events over the past few decades and look forward to the opportunities we have in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, good afternoon. I guess maybe if we could start on the cost side and maybe unpack, I think you said $20 million in the quarter, I think $100 million is the total program. Can you give us a little sense maybe by segment how that played out? Any examples that you can provide in terms of detail would be great too. And then I guess as you think forward, is it sort of progressive from the 20 to the 100 over the several quarters? Any sort of insight there? And I guess in that context, boxes were down sequentially for the first time in quite some time. So just kind of curious how that is sort of part of the plan if it is?
Brad Delco: Chris, I'll try to address the first part and I'll pass it over to Darren to address the second part. Really there's progress across all areas of the business. And so when we think about, as we laid out last quarter, what are the three buckets that we were targeting for this initiative? It was around efficiency and productivity. That's not just in the business, that's also in back office and how all that gets allocated to businesses. Driving better asset utilization, I mean, saw that in intermodal. We certainly saw that and you heard some comments about almost record performance in our tractor utilization in our dray operations. You saw good improvement in productivity in Dedicated. I wouldn't want to say one segment versus the other, but I think you've seen it in the results across the board. In terms of how we're going to progress going forward, I said in my comments, we're going to give you an update each quarter. We said we think most of this will reveal itself next year. Listen, we're off to a good start. We wanted to share that and I think you see it in the results. And while we do speak to it and we will speak to it each quarter, really the intent here is for you guys to see it in the results. And I'm glad that you guys can see it in the results we printed this afternoon. So I'm going to pass it over to Darren and let him address maybe the container count question and appreciate the question, Chris.
Darren Field: Yes. I mean, the container count isn't down. We have equipment that reaches useful life every quarter. It's a small amount. Sometimes there's a repair bill that may be greater than what the book value of that piece of equipment is, and we'll retire it. The other component is we've worked closely with Dedicated in a few examples where we found what had been leased trailers in an account, we were able to use containers instead. It's a pretty small number, but those would be the kind of moving pieces there. Nothing significant in terms of a real change in direction on container equipment.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Brian Ossenbeck: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I think Mike was giving some commentary about pricing for next year. I think it was in ICS low to mid-single. So hoping you can kind of run through what you're expecting across the different modes. And if I'm hearing you correctly, lowering the cost to serve, if rates do stay flat or don't move a whole lot for next year, it sounds like the structural reductions here mean that the performance like this can be more durable and perhaps even better whenever we do get to that long-awaited upcycle? Thank you.
Nick Hobbs: Yes. Thank you. I was really talking about what we've seen in recent bids and the awards that we've seen, not really what we thought next year was going to be on rates. But we've seen in ICS in particular, we've seen some success and growth in the amount of loads and in our pricing as we kind of focus on the more difficult challenging business that's not as commoditized, and so I think you see that in our gross margin. So it's just the type of business that we're working on that we saw that. And then Brian, to the second part of your question, I mean, clearly, the rate environment has been challenged now for quite some time for our industry. This initiative, again, that we launched, you really dig in on the deep into all the details, we have a spreadsheet that has over 100 lines of things that we're going to attack. And we've had very healthy debates around our executive table about what's structural, what's temporary, what we think are just cost avoidance versus are things that we're removing. And the numbers we're sharing, I mean, I think we said last quarter, our goal is and what we've identified as something far greater than $100 million. We've always been, I believe we've always been a fairly conservative company. We have a very strong say-do culture. If we say something, we're really setting out to do it. And so we're comfortable sharing the $100 million. Again, we're off to a good start. Our hope is while we've had tremendous headwinds in this industry, at some point headwinds will turn to tailwinds. And I think it will make it, it'll make the work we're doing look even stronger. Again, in my comments, you heard us say, we really are trying to set this business up to drive stronger incrementals when the market is more in our favor. And I think some of the discipline we have around cost is setting us up very nicely for that.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Don't know who wants to answer this, maybe Darren or Spencer or even Brad, but you've talked about the demand challenges. We all know about that. Pricing in the spot market doesn't seem to have done very much from three months ago either. But if you look at revenue per load in both intermodal and you had a pretty nice sequential improvement. So I'm trying to understand is that a decision you have to make versus volume, volume versus pricing? Is that a mix situation? Is that surcharges? And is that now the starting point? You always talk about like the cake being baked into the next year. Given that sequential increase down to 3Q, is this the starting point of which the cake is baked? Or is there a risk that that could actually move backward closer to the 2Q levels?
Darren Field: Okay. This is Darren. I'll try to tackle at least part of that. If Spencer has anything to add, he can certainly jump in. So we've often talked about we implement about 30% of prices in the first quarter, thirty percent second quarter, 30% third quarter, and call it 10% in the fourth quarter. I have long said the third quarter is the best time to see the results of the previous bid cycle. And I think that's what we did just show in terms of the results is that's a fully implemented bid season. What is washed in the results is there is some good pricing movement in the headhauls. There is some negative pricing in backhauls. And when you combine them, it looks relatively muted in terms of price per load. We reported minus 1%. And so I don't know that the sequential change did that come from some sort of a mix shift? It could have probably has some element of mix in there. I would say while our transcon volumes weren't up year over year, I do believe our transcon volumes were up sequentially. And so that can play a role in terms of what happens sequentially from a revenue per load position.
Nick Hobbs: Yes. And Jonathan, this is Nick. I'll talk about ICS. I would just say it's really mix in ours and type of business from just think about team or hazmat, just various different things that we're going after. It's a little bit more difficult, multi-stop. So those carry a little higher rate. So it's the type of business that we're targeting in ICS.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So I want to follow-up maybe similar to that last question. So obviously, very good sequential margin improvement from Q2 to Q3 in intermodal. Like how much of that do you think is the cost side of what you're talking about versus the yield side? I know we had earlier peak season surcharges this year. Ultimately, I'm trying to just figure out like the sustainability of this and as costs continue to ramp, should we be expecting further sort of sequential improvement off of this trough? Q2 to Q3, further improvement in Q3 to Q4, or is it not necessarily going to play out that way given some of the puts and takes with timing of peak surcharges and things like that?
Darren Field: Well, clearly, peak season surcharges got a lot of press. We went early because a lot of customers had believed that they needed extra capacity. I wouldn't say that the third quarter was a particularly strong peak season surcharge quarter. Frankly, we were disappointed in demand off the West Coast during the quarter and even adjusted our peak program in the middle of the quarter as an example. So I wouldn't want our analysts to believe that that's driven largely by peak season charges. Really when we set out with our bid strategy a year ago, we wanted to grow clearly. We wanted to improve price and we wanted to improve balance. And the improvement in balance, whether that be from growth westbound or an improvement in some price eastbound in the headhauls. I mean, of that result is driving improvements that we feel confident we can continue to sustain as we move forward. The cost side, we did, we were able to implement some small technology enhancements during the summer that really began at the end of the second quarter that helped define for our entire operations planning team some new flexibility that our customers had given us in some cases. And from that, we were able to drive real efficiency in our driver base. We were able to drive out some empty miles on the drayage system. So these are areas that we feel are sustainable. And as we continue to look for opportunities to grow, what I don't want anyone to hear is that growing in imbalanced lanes is a bad thing. It doesn't have to be bad. It just ultimately the pricing on those loads has to cover the cost of positioning empties. And in a lot of cases, I think our customers are beginning to look hard at their supply chains, what's happening with them, and can we look into the future and find a way to get back growing in markets that maybe are in balance that doesn't have to be a bad thing for us. But I believe the cost improvements that we made during the quarter, we must sustain those moving forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Brady Lares with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brady Lares: Hey, great. Thanks. I wanted to touch on DCS for just a moment. Sales have continued to be pretty strong over the last few quarters despite trade uncertainty and a tough freight backdrop. Can you talk about what's driving these wins at this point? Four years into a freight recession? And despite the strength in sales, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you saw a pretty meaningful improvement in margins. Can you think of help us think about how much of that was just an improvement in your cost to serve versus kind of a maturation of these earlier sales?
Brad Hicks: Yes. Thanks, Brady. This is Brad. First, let me say just how remarkably proud I am of our entire team in DCS. The effort, the service, our drivers, maintenance teams, all the support personnel, our operators, just fantastic results in the quarter, both from an execution standpoint, from a safety standpoint, and certainly from a value creation and value delivery to our customers. And I think that the reason I say that is, I think that is one of the differentiations for J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is really our CVD program, customer value delivery. And so when I think about the value that we can create for our customers, both through creative solutions, but also just our density and our ability to leverage and share our resources across multiple customers and multiple business types to really drive and create valuable solutions. The second part of that is, yes, we have worked hard and similar to Darren, there's a variety of initiatives that we've kicked off. Some earlier in the year, some more recent. There's been great work done by our maintenance teams helping lower our cost to serve, both by creating more uptime for our equipment and also lowering the cost of the actual maintenance program that we have. And then lastly, risk is a critical component of private fleet, and the environment we're in and what insurance has done the last several years that we've talked about often. And we're doing a fantastic job there, as Shelley mentioned and Nick did as well in the prepared comments. And so can't really say it's one thing. It's all those things together that makes our program different, we believe. And I think that that's why we've continued to have success even though the backdrop of this market has been pretty terrible as we all know.
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ken Hoexter: Great. Good afternoon. Nick, you mentioned kind of seeing signs of impacts of ELP and the P1 visas. Is that what's driving kind of spot rates up the last few weeks? Is that capacity removal already being seen in the market? Not the demand side, but the supply side? And then Shelley or Darren, I think you mentioned about the state of the potential rail mergers, but have you had conversations with UNP or Norfolk on sustaining your access or anything? Is that a discussion you've had at this point? Ahead of their filing?
Nick Hobbs: Yes. Well, Ken, I'll start with one and let Darren get over to question two here in a second. So question one, yes, that's the reason you've seen spot rates up in the last couple of weeks. It's been because of enforcement activity and when you see the pockets, I would say it's been able to cover freight, it's just tightened it up and so we've seen a little tightness in probably eight to 10 markets and I think you can kind of follow the news around and see where ICE is active and in big metropolitan areas. And so it's a combination of non-domicile. It's also some cabotage. It's also some fear factors. But we're prepared for that for whatever happens. We're set up with intermodal, dedicated, our brokerage, just like when we went through COVID. We will be able to get the capacity no matter what happens in the market. So but we are seeing it in some spots, just a little notice, nothing extreme.
Darren Field: And for your second question there, Ken, clearly got two questions in there, very different subject. I don't know how that slipped by the new IR guy. So I'm not going to talk through any kind of rail conversations. I think it is important that all of our shareholders and all of our customers hear any future merger that would be approved for whatever reason has been perceived that J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. would have to move our traffic to CSX. And that's not accurate at all. There's nothing about a future state new railroad that would mean our current Norfolk Southern footprint that we have today would be required to change. I think we referenced that we would intend to speak to all of the railroads to make sure that we can solve for our customers' networks and continue to be what we've been to the market for decades now. And that's just drive home the ability to take a customer's needs, translate that into what the railroad capacity and capabilities are, combine it with our world-class drayage system, and provide intermodal solutions for those customers using the best solution available. And that will be our approach for as long as I'm here.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jordan Alliger: Yes, hi. So given sort of the color and commentary on customers still expect peak season and load still to advance inland against the pull forward, is there any way you could sort of put that together a little bit and think through sort of loads and volumes for you guys relative to what we just saw in the third quarter as we look out the next quarter or so? Just from a high-level perspective, thanks.
Spencer Frazier: Yes. Hey, John, this is Spencer. Thanks for the question. The main point that I really wanted to make there, there's been quite a few headlines that come out and say, hey, peak is over. There's not going to be a peak. And I totally agree with that from an ocean perspective. But we always have to remember that that domestic, that inland supply chain, the timing of that is really driven by actual consumer and customer demand. And that's going to take place at the same time it does every year, associated with the holidays. So that was kind of point number one. And then back to our customers are expecting a peak season. I think even the NRS came out with their retail sales number or retail sales for September being up 5.7%. Our customers are working to keep their consumers, to keep all of us engaged and make sure that they can hit their sales targets and goals for the holiday season. And that they're expecting to do that. Now for us, definitely the deals and agreements and support that we have for our customers is unique. And each one of our customers is unique on how they're executing their peak volume. But the big thing when you think about going forward to your question, you look at last year, last year was artificially inflated due to the East Coast strike concerns and other issues. And that really started in the '4. And carried through to really where West Coast port volumes were up 20% significantly all the way through the year. I expect the comps associated with that change and really the current import volumes to really be challenged all the way through March '6. So I think that where we're at today and what we've done and what we're going to do to help our customers through peak, we're looking forward to doing that. And working with those customers that have provided us with the forecast and what their needs are.
Operator: The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ravi Shanker: Great, thanks. I'm going to throw in a long-term question here and maybe sharing this topic close to your heart. Just kind of given you guys probably led peers on JV360 and all the tech investments kind of many years ago, can you talk about kind of what you guys are working on right now? What that technology capital envelope looks like? Key initiatives there and kind of how the ICS business would look like from a tech and automation perspective maybe three, four years from now? Thank you.
Shelley Simpson: Thank you, Ravi. And love to talk about technology. Our strategy is rooted in how we transform our logistics. We want to be smarter, more predictive, and automated through JBM360. And if you just think about what our platform does, it supports $2 billion in carrier freight transactions, and that gives us scale to innovate. And we could do that quickly and effectively. As I think about what we're working on, we've deployed 50 AI agents. That's across the business. We're trying to automate tasks, streamline our operations. And maybe just a few examples. Today, 60% of our third-party care check calls, those are automated. More than 73% of our orders are auto accepted, 80% of our paper invoices are paid without a manual touch. Our dynamic quote API responds to 2 million quotes a year. And we've automated about 100,000 or a little more than one hundred thousand hours annually across our highway, dedicated, and CE teams. And so it's not just about AI for us, it is about how we think about technology, but how does it empower our people. And so whether that's engineering better processes or using robotic automation, leveraging AI, we're focused on helping our teams work smarter and become more efficient. And that's going to improve our operational performance and enhance our customers' visibility and their experience. So as we continue to refine our technology strategy, our goal remains very clear to us. We're going to deliver measurable gains in cost savings, we're going to increase our customer satisfaction, and we want to gain market share as a result. Now as I think about ICS, they have a great opportunity to do even more work when it comes to automation because the nature of the new customers they're onboarding are less sophisticated from a technology perspective. So it's really a new for them. If you think about our overall company, our company and the percentage of customers that we have that are large shippers, we're heavily distorted to. And so I would say that's our opportunity to really grow with those small to midsized customers and that's where automation will help significantly. We've got a clear path of things that we're working on. And then I want to make sure that I do mention we did talk about Up Labs, which is a company that we've partnered with and really having them attack two of our areas that we believe need rewritten from a process and even more importantly technology where they're integrating AI into those processes. Those two areas I would say, we're in the middle of, really investigating and determining next path forward. But for us, all of this is about efficiency across our entire system. And so that's part of our lowering our cost to serve. It's part of our transformation work. And I don't think it just has to be AI that makes that happen. It could be a combination of processes, robotics, and AI.
Operator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors with SIG. Please go ahead.
Bascome Majors: Brad, as you get into the planning period for next year, can you talk a little bit about some of the higher visibility big-ticket cost items in the budget, be it health and welfare or insurance? Just what is the inflationary backdrop you're continuing with now? And how do you think shifts into next year? And you put it on the blender with the $50 million plus incremental cost savings, how much do you really need to get from pricing and growth to offset that? Thank you.
Brad Delco: Well, Bascome, the way you started with that question, I was just going to say yes, yes, yes, and yes. I would say the big areas where we're seeing inflationary pressure always on our people and wages but in particular around benefits. Group medical healthcare costs are, I don't think it's unique to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. I think it's a challenge for any and all businesses. So that's certainly an area that I think is a hot topic as we're thinking about planning for 2026. Insurance, yes, we're in the renewal process now. It's probably too early to comment on that. But particularly as you get into certain layers or areas of coverage, we're seeing greater cost and largely because of how and how these claims are settling. And I think it's again, it's not that's not unique to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. The thing that I'm really proud of is, and you heard Shelley and Nick both talk to it and our whole company should be proud of, is our safety performance. I mean, we're coming off of a very strong year last year, which was best, which bested the prior year. And year to date, I'll knock on wood here, our performance is better than last year and the best way to reduce our cost on claims and insurance items is to really to avoid any incidents. And so that's the goal. The goal is zero and we got a long ways to go to get there. In terms of what do we need, our customers I know are going to push hard unless there is a meaningful change or a change in the supply-demand balance. I think Nick alluded to the fact that there are maybe some things that are starting to pop up that might be reasons for more concern about what the capacity situation looks like going forward. But we got to at least get above inflation. And if inflation is running 3%, I feel like our industry needs something better than that to get into a healthier spot. And our industry is not in a healthy spot. And I think most of you who have covered this for a long time know that. So our goal and we had a lot of follow-up conversations after our last earnings call about is $100 million net or gross, and I jokingly will say this here, I've asked each of those investors to define it for me and they all gave me a different example. At the end of the day, lowering our cost to serve of $100 million, we want that to show up and be very visible to our owners. And we want to be obviously visible to you as well. But I would say we need something mid-single digits next year for our to at least get back on a healthier path to margin recovery and particularly for some of these transportation providers to reinvest or be at reinvestable levels. So that's a long answer. I know I didn't answer it specifically because I don't want to give guidance as to what our rate expectations might be next year. But I would hope the value that we're providing customers will allow us to earn an appropriate return on the investments and the risk we're taking serving those customers.
Operator: The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.
Tom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. Want to give Shelley a shot at a question here if she wants to take it or I guess could pass along certainly. But when I think about coming out of a downturn in the industry, it seems like there we look for kind of a catalyst to change the shipper mindset. And I know you've got tons of experience working with shippers over time. So do you think this the DOT efforts that you listed a number of them, I think there's a lot of focus on the non-domiciled CDL issue right now. But do you think that those DOT efforts are really causing a lot of concern in the mindset? And there's potentially a shift in that mindset that seems important to pricing. And then I guess within that is the 200,000 number DOT talked about, is that you think that sounds right? Or does that not sound right? Thank you.
Shelley Simpson: Yes. Thank you, Tom. And let me start and I'll have the team kind of jump in here. Overall. When I think about how our shippers are viewing the market, it has been a surprise to all of us. So to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and our shippers, how this market still is in the same place it's been over the more than three years. And so I would tell you, our customers a year ago they were prepared and understood the why. That we would need more price. It's not that our customers are unsympathetic to our position, but they're managing their costs based on what they see from a bid perspective and what they see from a cost perspective. And so, I think it's incumbent on us. One of the things I think is important is we are a growth company, but we're a disciplined growth company. We can't just grow. We have to be disciplined in our growth strategy. And making sure we articulate that. I'll tell you this Tom, as much as Darren's talked about our pricing change, although that might seem really simple to do, in this environment, those were very difficult discussions, but they were really fueled by our operational excellence and being able to talk to our customers about what great work we're doing and they saw value in that. I've not seen us have to fight so hard for 12% before. When you know inflation is so much more than that overall. So I would tell you, I think customers want to help us. We need the market to change in order to do that. Do I think that non-domicile CDL could be a catalyst? Sure. It would at least make a little more sense to me why there's so much capacity in the market versus just our statistics say today. But I would tell you things have to change from here. If that's one of the things that happens, then does that happen in the next twelve months? Does that take twenty-four months for it to happen? But let me just take a pause there and let Nick maybe you want to jump in on the non-doms.
Nick Hobbs: No, yes. And I might just add a couple of quick things here, Shelley. I totally agree. Our customers really the last two years have been planning for changes in cost that really didn't materialize because they didn't have to. I think some of the things that we're seeing right now with a little bit of a disconnect in spot price rates going up versus volumes going down, the first time we've seen that. Maybe in the history of some of the data. Our customers look at macro data and spot pricing and volumes. Let me go back to until they actually experience it or feel it at the dock level, until freight is not picked up. They won't make a meaningful change. So that's the area where we've got to give them confidence and predictability of our capacity and service, which we've done through operational excellence. That as this thing does change, whether it's near term or over time, they can count on us to take care of their business. Nick?
Nick Hobbs: I'll just add a couple of things. On the non-dom, I think the $200,000 is fairly legit. But I think there's a lot of other factors of drivers that's coming across the border, call it, cabotage. It should only be in the border zone. Is some good data out there. From a couple of sources that's come out recently to talk about that. And so I just think there's other factors that's going to continue to impact that. But really to see any impact in the speed, it's going to take the economic side along with the regulation side and that's what's going to drive the timing is those two. In my opinion.
Operator: The last question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Eric Morgan: Hey, good afternoon. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon actually. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on intermodal growth in the East. I think you referenced in the prepared remarks having the labor port issue kind of playing in there. So I'm just wondering how sustainable that level of growth is moving forward and maybe in the context of some of this different seasonality you're seeing this year would be helpful. Thanks.
Darren Field: Sure. So I think in reference to the labor situation, that had more to do with last year's comps on the West Coast. Volumes being strong. Our Eastern network volume really doesn't have a lot of interaction with the import economy a ton. I think that the Eastern network continues to be where we see the best highway to rail conversion opportunity. Our East network also includes Mexico as an example. And so we have really nice solid growth coming northbound out of Mexico as part of that. We think that the vast majority of the millions of loads that remain to be converted from highway to intermodal are in the East. So we're encouraged by our growth in the East, and we expect and anticipate we can continue to grow in the East for years to come.
Operator: This concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mrs. Shelley Simpson for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Shelley Simpson: Hey, thanks everyone for joining. Hey, we're pleased with our results in the short term, especially considering this environment. But we have more work to do and we're not satisfied. We're going to continue to remain focused on our priorities of operational excellence in both service and safety. We're going to scale into our investments through disciplined growth, and then we're going to keep repairing our margins, and that will drive stronger financial performance. We're a growth company. It's important, and we have the highest service across all five of our business units. I think the highest since I've been with the company from a consistency across the segments. We see that metric as a key enabler to execute on our strategy and maintain our say-do culture on delivering what we say and what we expect from ourselves. Thanks for your interest, and we'll see you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

This afternoon, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Shelley Simpson, our CFO, Brad Delco, Spencer Frazier, EVP of Sales and Marketing, our COO and President of Highway Services and Final Mile, Nick Hobbs, Brad Hicks, President of Dedicated Contract Services, and Darren Field, President of Intermodal. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?
Shelley Simpson: Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon. Throughout the year, our focus has been on three clear priorities: operational excellence, scaling into our investments, and continuing to repair our margins to drive stronger financial performance. We are executing these priorities with discipline and determination, guided by a strategy designed to strengthen our competitive position and unlock long-term value for our shareholders. I am highly confident that our approach is building a stronger company, one that is fully equipped to capitalize on meaningful growth opportunities ahead while driving stronger financial performance. Across our businesses, service levels remain excellent. We have systemically elevated our service standards to drive disciplined profitable growth with both new and existing customers. Even as overall freight demand softened during the quarter, our unwavering commitment to service enabled our intermodal and highway businesses to capture additional volume and outperform the market. Operational excellence is now synonymous with J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and we are leveraging this reputation to drive strategic growth and maximize returns on our investments to match the unique value and strong service levels we provide for customers. We remain focused on controlling what we can, optimizing costs in the near term without sacrificing our future earnings power potential. In addition, we are placing a heightened emphasis on operational efficiency throughout the organization. By streamlining processes, adopting best practices, and leveraging technology, we aim to utilize every resource as effectively as possible to maximize productivity and performance. Our initiative to lower our cost to serve, announced last quarter, is focused on removing structural costs from our business. The organization's collaborative efforts continue to gain momentum, and Brad will share more details on our progress. This initiative marks our latest evolution in expense discipline, and we are making good progress towards reaching our $100 million savings goal and advancing towards our long-term margin target. Now, let me address the elephant in the room: rail consolidation. J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.'s position is rooted in our commitment to delivering exceptional intermodal service and creating long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We recognize both the opportunities and risks that consolidation presents. But our decades of experience, including navigating seven prior Class I railroad mergers, and our thoughtfully developed long-term agreements and strong relationships with NS, CSX, and BNSF should provide the basis for us to adapt to any changes in the industry. As the largest domestic intermodal provider, our scale and influence allow us to coordinate complex intermodal moves and deliver unique solutions for our customers. We are consistently rated best in class by third-party industry surveys of intermodal customers. And our ability to deliver seamless, differentiated service across the entire North American intermodal network is a key competitive advantage. Our focus remains on providing reliable, efficient, and innovative service that benefits our customers now and into the future. As the rail industry evolves, we expect our proven adaptability and unwavering dedication to service will not only safeguard our leadership position but should also continuously set higher standards of excellence for our customers. I want to close by recognizing the entire organization for their hard work and progress across many areas of focus. The third quarter is extra special at J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. as it includes National Truck Driver and National Technician Appreciation Week. Our professional drivers and maintenance teams are the backbone of our success. And their record-breaking safety performance is a testament to their skill, dedication, and attention to safety every day. We appreciate all they do to keep our company, our customers, and our communities safe. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our newly appointed CFO, Brad Delco.
Brad Delco: Thanks, Shelley, and good afternoon. I will hit on some highlights of the quarter, review our capital allocation plan, and give an update on the lowering our cost to serve initiative. Let me start with the quarter. As you have already seen from our release, revenue was roughly flat year over year while operating income improved 8% and diluted earnings per share improved 18% versus the prior year period. While inflation in insurance, wages, and employee benefits and equipment costs were all up, our productivity and cost management efforts more than offset those headwinds to drive our improved results. Over the years, you have heard us talk about investing in our long-term growth, maintaining cost discipline without jeopardizing our future earnings power, and creating operating leverage when the market returns. Well, it's no secret the market hasn't returned yet, but the notable improvement in our financial performance this quarter should serve as a true testament to the talent and capabilities of the people throughout our organization and the execution of our strategy towards operational excellence in safety, service, and lowering our cost to serve. On capital allocation, our balance sheet remains healthy, maintaining leverage around our target of one times trailing twelve-month EBITDA while purchasing over $780 million or 5.4 million shares of our stock year to date. This aligns with our messaging around prefunding our long-term future growth during the downturn and having the flexibility with the strong cash flow generation of the business to be opportunistic with share repurchases as a way to return value to our shareholders. We will be disciplined in our capital allocation approach with investing in the business as priority number one, sustaining our investment-grade balance sheet, supporting future dividend growth, and finally continuing our opportunistic repurchases. Last quarter, we outlined our lowering our cost serve initiative to remove $100 million of structural costs from the business. I'm happy to share we are off to a good start, having eliminated greater than $20 million in the quarter. Examples of our success are in service efficiencies, balancing our networks, dynamically serving customers to meet their needs, focusing even more on discretionary spending, and driving greater asset utilization. We remain committed to updating you on our progress going forward. But our intent is to demonstrate our progress in our reported results rather than just speak to them. As we noted last quarter, we will realize a portion of these benefits this year, with the majority of the impact realized in 2026. Let me close with this and what I hope you take away from our quarter. First, our company continues to execute from a position of strength. We have been transparent with our strategy, our investments to be best prepared to service our customers' future capacity needs. Second, we also continue to remove structural costs from the business. We are off to a good start and have more work to do. Third, our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash, and we remain focused on generating strong returns with our deployed capital. We have been opportunistic with our share repurchases, all while maintaining modest leverage on our balance sheet. That concludes my remarks. Now I'd like to turn it over to Spencer.
Spencer Frazier: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our view of the market and some feedback we are hearing from our customers. Overall demand trended below normal seasonality for much of the quarter outside of the seasonal lift we saw at quarter-end. On the supply side, truckload capacity continued to exit the market, and the pace of exits is accelerating. But the soft demand environment is likely muting the market impact of capacity attrition. Outside of recent weeks, truckload spot rates remained under pressure in the quarter. More recent regulatory developments and, more importantly, regulatory enforcement is having an impact on capacity. While this industry may have a chicken little reputation when it comes to predicting capacity changes, the capacity bubble may be deflating as we speak. In the near term, customers will remain skeptical of any predicted change, only believing it when they experience it. Shifting to intermodal, volumes declined 1% year over year. We believe our volumes held up better relative to the broader truckload market decline, primarily because more customers are converting freight to intermodal from the highway as they see our commitment to operational excellence differentiating J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. Intermodal from the competition. The service we provide ranks us at the top of our customer scorecards, and we continue to be ranked at the top of industry surveys as well, with a Net Promoter Score of 53. When we go to market, we work with customers to dynamically solve their supply chain needs by designing and executing our operations to meet their requirements. For example, in our intermodal business, customers trust us to select the most efficient service regardless of the rail provider to seamlessly move their freight throughout North America. Today, roughly half of our interchange volume on transcontinental shipments occurs through a steel wheel interchange. This ratio can change dynamically and demonstrates our ability to be agile at scale to execute and meet our customer expectations. Regardless of how the rail landscape and operating scenarios might change over the next couple of years, we remain committed to delivering exceptional service and growing with our customers. Regarding the current peak season, the strong container volume into the West Coast in July generated headlines regarding a potential pull forward. Ocean peak season came early. That said, it is important to disconnect the timing of peak season on the water from the peak season of the inland supply chain. Our customers are still expecting a peak season, although the magnitude and duration of peak volumes will vary. Our conversations indicate there is a large amount of freight that was imported early that hasn't moved through the inland supply chain yet. No one has canceled Christmas. I'll close with some customer feedback. Our customers realize the financial health of the transportation industry is not great. And as a result, they are choosing to do more with the best carriers and more with fewer carriers. Shippers are focused on creating efficiencies in their supply chains by working with providers who are safe and financially sound and who execute with agility and predictability. Our scroll of services continues to operate from a position of strength, creating value as the go-to transportation provider for our customers. I would now like to turn the call over to Nick.
Nick Hobbs: Thanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our areas of focus across our operations, followed by an update on our Final Mile, truckload, and brokerage businesses. I'll start on our safety performance. Safety is a core piece of our culture and a key differentiator of our value proposition in the market. We are coming off of two consecutive years of record performance measured by DOT preventable accidents per million miles, and our safety results through the third quarter are performing even better than these record performances. This performance is a testament to our people and the attention to detail they bring to the job every day, as well as our focus on proper training and technology. Our safety performance is a key piece of driving out cost and will continue to be an area of focus. While the ultimate impact on industry capacity is hard to pinpoint, we believe the recent developments on regulations and enforcement, when taken together, could have a noticeable impact on available industry capacity. These include new regulations around English language proficiency, B1 Visas, FMCSA, biometric ID verification, and non-domiciled CDLs. Importantly, for J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., we do not expect to see any material impact on our capacity. There have been some signs based on what we are seeing in our truck and brokerage operations that it could have a broader industry impact. Moving to the business, let's start with the final mile. As we said last quarter, business conditions in our end markets remain challenged with soft demand for furniture, exercise equipment, and appliances. We continue to see positive demand in our fulfillment network driven by off-price retail. Going forward, we expect market conditions to remain challenged through at least year-end. Our focus remains on providing the highest service levels, being safe and secure, ensuring that the value we provide in the market is realized to drive appropriate returns. In 2026, we do anticipate losing some legacy appliance-related business, but we will be working diligently on backfilling with other brands and service offerings in this segment of our business. Moving to JBT, our focus in this business hasn't changed, and we are winning business with strong service from both new and existing customers, leading to our highest quarterly volume in over a decade. We are remaining disciplined with our growth to ensure our network remains balanced in order to drive the best utilization of our trailing assets. Going forward, we are pleased with the direction of this business in this soft demand environment and the progress we are making on lowering our cost to serve. We see an opportunity for further efficiency and automation gains in the future as we continue to leverage our 360 platform. That said, meaningful improvements in our profitability in this business will be driven by greater levels of rate improvement and overall demand for truckload drop trailing solutions. I'll close with ICS. During the third quarter, volumes modestly improved sequentially as new volume from recent bid wins was partially offset by soft demand in the overall truckload market. Truckload spot rates remained depressed throughout the quarter, but we saw gross margins remain healthy. We are almost through bid season and are pleased with the awards we have received, with rates up low to mid-single digits, winning volume with new customers. Our focus here remains on profitable growth with the right customers where we can differentiate ourselves with service. Going forward, we will remain focused on scaling into our while continuing to make improvements to our cost structure and leveraging our 360 platform to drive greater efficiency and automation, which will help lower our cost to serve. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brad.
Brad Hicks: Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon everybody. I'll provide an update on our dedicated results. Starting with the quarter, at a high level, our third quarter results were very strong, particularly in light of this challenging freight environment. We believe our results are a testament to the strength and diversification of our model, the value we create for our customers, and how we drive accountability at each site and customer location. As a result, we continue to see good demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions. During the third quarter, we sold approximately 280 trucks of new deals. As a reminder, our annual net sales target is for 800 to 1,000 new trucks per year, and we would be on pace with this target absent the known losses disclosed almost two years ago. Encouragingly, our overall sales pipeline remains strong as our value proposition in the market remains differentiated. Our sales cycle in dedicated is typically eighteen months from start to finish, and our pipeline includes both large and small fleets at various stages of completion, all underwritten to our return targets. Overall, I remain pleased with the momentum and activity in the pipeline. As I just mentioned and as we have communicated over the past eighteen months, we have had visibility to fleet losses that wrapped up in early July, which negatively impacted our third quarter '25 truck count by about 85 trucks versus our second quarter results. Navigating through these losses, in addition to call outs we've had related to some customer bankruptcies and the overall market dynamics, demonstrates our discipline and strong execution. While we were losing locations that had historically delivered mature margins, we were simultaneously absorbing startup costs from onboarding new business. Despite facing these two margin pressures, we still maintain double-digit margins during this period. I am extremely proud of all of our teams for their effort. Hope going forward, knowing that most of our fleet losses are behind us, is that we are back on track with our net fleet growth plan moving forward. We believe the performance of our dedicated business has been a standout not only for our company but also the industry. We have great visibility into the financial performance of each account, which provides a high level of accountability at each location and a diversified customer base with our managers on-site with our customers, which we believe creates unique value that is a differentiator for us. Going forward, with our known losses behind us, our expectation for modest fleet growth in 2025 has not changed. As we have said previously, when we sell new truck deals, and that business starts up, we do incur some expenses as that business is onboarded. That said, this isn't new for us. We are starting up new customer locations each quarter. Given our progress with respect to lowering our cost to serve, we expect our 2025 operating income to be approximately flat compared to 2024. The magnitude of any potential variance higher or lower to this outlook will be driven by the number of locations we start up during the quarter. We believe the setup is favorable for us to continue our growth trajectory in 2026 and beyond. Our business model and value proposition are differentiated in the market and continue to attract new customers. We remain confident in our ability to compound our growth over many years to further penetrate our large addressable market. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Darren.
Darren Field: Thank you, Brad. Thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon. I'd like to start by saying I feel really good about our performance and how our strategy and solid execution drove meaningful improvements in our results. I believe this is a true testament to our focus on operational excellence, cost discipline, and progress on lowering our cost serve initiative. Before we get into more detail on the results, I want to follow up on some of Shelley's comments regarding the potential for Class I rail consolidation. First, there are still a lot of unknowns. But I am confident J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. should be a primary consideration and actively engaged in all discussions involving the future of the intermodal industry as well as the execution of all Class one's desire to take share from the highway to grow their intermodal service offering. We have offered seamless transcontinental intermodal services for decades, connecting BNSF with both Eastern railroads, and believe that opportunity could exist well into the future regardless of the various outcomes we know are either announced or speculated in the market. We continue to see a large opportunity to convert highway shipments to intermodal, and if the motivation for consolidation is to compete more with trucks, we believe this will present our industry-leading intermodal franchise additional growth opportunities. We are one of the largest purchasers of rail capacity in North America, and we will engage in discussions with all rail providers to execute on a strategy and plan that we think is in the best interest of our shareholders. Turning to the quarter, demand for our domestic intermodal service wasn't all that strong, but nonetheless, we saw sequential improvement in volumes and executed some of the most efficient dray service in our history, particularly in September. As Spencer mentioned, we still expect the peak season as lots of volume that moved on the water earlier this year will still need to advance in the inland supply chain ahead of the holidays. Volumes in the quarter were down 1% year over year and by month were down 3% in July, down 2% in August, and flat in September. After seeing unique strength off the West Coast last year due to the threat of the East Coast port labor disruption, TransCon volumes were down percent in the quarter, while Eastern loads were up 6%. As we've communicated all year, we had a bid season strategy focused on getting better balance in our network to grow volumes and repair our margins with more price, particularly in our headhaul lanes. Last quarter, we talked about our success in the bid season, particularly around balance, and we think that success combined with our lowering our cost to serve initiatives were key contributors to our year-over-year and sequential performance improvement. Our service performance remains strong. Our primary rail providers BNSF, NS, and CSX continue to deliver excellent service, which we believe is taking share from Highway. I am confident our service offering is being recognized in the market. Customers are reengaging with us with additional opportunities largely driven by our differentiated service and value compared to both highway and IMCs. As you all are keenly aware, we have the capacity and ability to execute on a meaningful growth plan over the coming years based on investments we've already made. In closing, we remain very confident in our intermodal franchise and the value we provide for our customers. We have shown the ability to grow and generate strong returns through many rail consolidation events over the past few decades and look forward to the opportunities we have in front of us. With that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Chris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Hey, good afternoon. I guess maybe if we could start on the cost side and maybe unpack, I think you said $20 million in the quarter, I think $100 million is the total program. Can you give us a little sense maybe by segment how that played out? Any examples that you can provide in terms of detail would be great too. And then I guess as you think forward, is it sort of progressive from the 20 to the 100 over the several quarters? Any sort of insight there? And I guess in that context, boxes were down sequentially for the first time in quite some time. So just kind of curious how that is sort of part of the plan if it is?
Brad Delco: Chris, I'll try to address the first part and I'll pass it over to Darren to address the second part. Really there's progress across all areas of the business. And so when we think about, as we laid out last quarter, what are the three buckets that we were targeting for this initiative? It was around efficiency and productivity. That's not just in the business, that's also in back office and how all that gets allocated to businesses. Driving better asset utilization, I mean, saw that in intermodal. We certainly saw that and you heard some comments about almost record performance in our tractor utilization in our dray operations. You saw good improvement in productivity in Dedicated. I wouldn't want to say one segment versus the other, but I think you've seen it in the results across the board. In terms of how we're going to progress going forward, I said in my comments, we're going to give you an update each quarter. We said we think most of this will reveal itself next year. Listen, we're off to a good start. We wanted to share that and I think you see it in the results. And while we do speak to it and we will speak to it each quarter, really the intent here is for you guys to see it in the results. And I'm glad that you guys can see it in the results we printed this afternoon. So I'm going to pass it over to Darren and let him address maybe the container count question and appreciate the question, Chris.
Darren Field: Yes. I mean, the container count isn't down. We have equipment that reaches useful life every quarter. It's a small amount. Sometimes there's a repair bill that may be greater than what the book value of that piece of equipment is, and we'll retire it. The other component is we've worked closely with Dedicated in a few examples where we found what had been leased trailers in an account, we were able to use containers instead. It's a pretty small number, but those would be the kind of moving pieces there. Nothing significant in terms of a real change in direction on container equipment.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Brian Ossenbeck: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I think Mike was giving some commentary about pricing for next year. I think it was in ICS low to mid-single. So hoping you can kind of run through what you're expecting across the different modes. And if I'm hearing you correctly, lowering the cost to serve, if rates do stay flat or don't move a whole lot for next year, it sounds like the structural reductions here mean that the performance like this can be more durable and perhaps even better whenever we do get to that long-awaited upcycle? Thank you.
Nick Hobbs: Yes. Thank you. I was really talking about what we've seen in recent bids and the awards that we've seen, not really what we thought next year was going to be on rates. But we've seen in ICS in particular, we've seen some success and growth in the amount of loads and in our pricing as we kind of focus on the more difficult challenging business that's not as commoditized, and so I think you see that in our gross margin. So it's just the type of business that we're working on that we saw that. And then Brian, to the second part of your question, I mean, clearly, the rate environment has been challenged now for quite some time for our industry. This initiative, again, that we launched, you really dig in on the deep into all the details, we have a spreadsheet that has over 100 lines of things that we're going to attack. And we've had very healthy debates around our executive table about what's structural, what's temporary, what we think are just cost avoidance versus are things that we're removing. And the numbers we're sharing, I mean, I think we said last quarter, our goal is and what we've identified as something far greater than $100 million. We've always been, I believe we've always been a fairly conservative company. We have a very strong say-do culture. If we say something, we're really setting out to do it. And so we're comfortable sharing the $100 million. Again, we're off to a good start. Our hope is while we've had tremendous headwinds in this industry, at some point headwinds will turn to tailwinds. And I think it will make it, it'll make the work we're doing look even stronger. Again, in my comments, you heard us say, we really are trying to set this business up to drive stronger incrementals when the market is more in our favor. And I think some of the discipline we have around cost is setting us up very nicely for that.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Don't know who wants to answer this, maybe Darren or Spencer or even Brad, but you've talked about the demand challenges. We all know about that. Pricing in the spot market doesn't seem to have done very much from three months ago either. But if you look at revenue per load in both intermodal and you had a pretty nice sequential improvement. So I'm trying to understand is that a decision you have to make versus volume, volume versus pricing? Is that a mix situation? Is that surcharges? And is that now the starting point? You always talk about like the cake being baked into the next year. Given that sequential increase down to 3Q, is this the starting point of which the cake is baked? Or is there a risk that that could actually move backward closer to the 2Q levels?
Darren Field: Okay. This is Darren. I'll try to tackle at least part of that. If Spencer has anything to add, he can certainly jump in. So we've often talked about we implement about 30% of prices in the first quarter, thirty percent second quarter, 30% third quarter, and call it 10% in the fourth quarter. I have long said the third quarter is the best time to see the results of the previous bid cycle. And I think that's what we did just show in terms of the results is that's a fully implemented bid season. What is washed in the results is there is some good pricing movement in the headhauls. There is some negative pricing in backhauls. And when you combine them, it looks relatively muted in terms of price per load. We reported minus 1%. And so I don't know that the sequential change did that come from some sort of a mix shift? It could have probably has some element of mix in there. I would say while our transcon volumes weren't up year over year, I do believe our transcon volumes were up sequentially. And so that can play a role in terms of what happens sequentially from a revenue per load position.
Nick Hobbs: Yes. And Jonathan, this is Nick. I'll talk about ICS. I would just say it's really mix in ours and type of business from just think about team or hazmat, just various different things that we're going after. It's a little bit more difficult, multi-stop. So those carry a little higher rate. So it's the type of business that we're targeting in ICS.
Operator: The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So I want to follow-up maybe similar to that last question. So obviously, very good sequential margin improvement from Q2 to Q3 in intermodal. Like how much of that do you think is the cost side of what you're talking about versus the yield side? I know we had earlier peak season surcharges this year. Ultimately, I'm trying to just figure out like the sustainability of this and as costs continue to ramp, should we be expecting further sort of sequential improvement off of this trough? Q2 to Q3, further improvement in Q3 to Q4, or is it not necessarily going to play out that way given some of the puts and takes with timing of peak surcharges and things like that?
Darren Field: Well, clearly, peak season surcharges got a lot of press. We went early because a lot of customers had believed that they needed extra capacity. I wouldn't say that the third quarter was a particularly strong peak season surcharge quarter. Frankly, we were disappointed in demand off the West Coast during the quarter and even adjusted our peak program in the middle of the quarter as an example. So I wouldn't want our analysts to believe that that's driven largely by peak season charges. Really when we set out with our bid strategy a year ago, we wanted to grow clearly. We wanted to improve price and we wanted to improve balance. And the improvement in balance, whether that be from growth westbound or an improvement in some price eastbound in the headhauls. I mean, of that result is driving improvements that we feel confident we can continue to sustain as we move forward. The cost side, we did, we were able to implement some small technology enhancements during the summer that really began at the end of the second quarter that helped define for our entire operations planning team some new flexibility that our customers had given us in some cases. And from that, we were able to drive real efficiency in our driver base. We were able to drive out some empty miles on the drayage system. So these are areas that we feel are sustainable. And as we continue to look for opportunities to grow, what I don't want anyone to hear is that growing in imbalanced lanes is a bad thing. It doesn't have to be bad. It just ultimately the pricing on those loads has to cover the cost of positioning empties. And in a lot of cases, I think our customers are beginning to look hard at their supply chains, what's happening with them, and can we look into the future and find a way to get back growing in markets that maybe are in balance that doesn't have to be a bad thing for us. But I believe the cost improvements that we made during the quarter, we must sustain those moving forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Brady Lares with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Brady Lares: Hey, great. Thanks. I wanted to touch on DCS for just a moment. Sales have continued to be pretty strong over the last few quarters despite trade uncertainty and a tough freight backdrop. Can you talk about what's driving these wins at this point? Four years into a freight recession? And despite the strength in sales, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you saw a pretty meaningful improvement in margins. Can you think of help us think about how much of that was just an improvement in your cost to serve versus kind of a maturation of these earlier sales?
Brad Hicks: Yes. Thanks, Brady. This is Brad. First, let me say just how remarkably proud I am of our entire team in DCS. The effort, the service, our drivers, maintenance teams, all the support personnel, our operators, just fantastic results in the quarter, both from an execution standpoint, from a safety standpoint, and certainly from a value creation and value delivery to our customers. And I think that the reason I say that is, I think that is one of the differentiations for J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is really our CVD program, customer value delivery. And so when I think about the value that we can create for our customers, both through creative solutions, but also just our density and our ability to leverage and share our resources across multiple customers and multiple business types to really drive and create valuable solutions. The second part of that is, yes, we have worked hard and similar to Darren, there's a variety of initiatives that we've kicked off. Some earlier in the year, some more recent. There's been great work done by our maintenance teams helping lower our cost to serve, both by creating more uptime for our equipment and also lowering the cost of the actual maintenance program that we have. And then lastly, risk is a critical component of private fleet, and the environment we're in and what insurance has done the last several years that we've talked about often. And we're doing a fantastic job there, as Shelley mentioned and Nick did as well in the prepared comments. And so can't really say it's one thing. It's all those things together that makes our program different, we believe. And I think that that's why we've continued to have success even though the backdrop of this market has been pretty terrible as we all know.
Operator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Ken Hoexter: Great. Good afternoon. Nick, you mentioned kind of seeing signs of impacts of ELP and the P1 visas. Is that what's driving kind of spot rates up the last few weeks? Is that capacity removal already being seen in the market? Not the demand side, but the supply side? And then Shelley or Darren, I think you mentioned about the state of the potential rail mergers, but have you had conversations with UNP or Norfolk on sustaining your access or anything? Is that a discussion you've had at this point? Ahead of their filing?
Nick Hobbs: Yes. Well, Ken, I'll start with one and let Darren get over to question two here in a second. So question one, yes, that's the reason you've seen spot rates up in the last couple of weeks. It's been because of enforcement activity and when you see the pockets, I would say it's been able to cover freight, it's just tightened it up and so we've seen a little tightness in probably eight to 10 markets and I think you can kind of follow the news around and see where ICE is active and in big metropolitan areas. And so it's a combination of non-domicile. It's also some cabotage. It's also some fear factors. But we're prepared for that for whatever happens. We're set up with intermodal, dedicated, our brokerage, just like when we went through COVID. We will be able to get the capacity no matter what happens in the market. So but we are seeing it in some spots, just a little notice, nothing extreme.
Darren Field: And for your second question there, Ken, clearly got two questions in there, very different subject. I don't know how that slipped by the new IR guy. So I'm not going to talk through any kind of rail conversations. I think it is important that all of our shareholders and all of our customers hear any future merger that would be approved for whatever reason has been perceived that J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. would have to move our traffic to CSX. And that's not accurate at all. There's nothing about a future state new railroad that would mean our current Norfolk Southern footprint that we have today would be required to change. I think we referenced that we would intend to speak to all of the railroads to make sure that we can solve for our customers' networks and continue to be what we've been to the market for decades now. And that's just drive home the ability to take a customer's needs, translate that into what the railroad capacity and capabilities are, combine it with our world-class drayage system, and provide intermodal solutions for those customers using the best solution available. And that will be our approach for as long as I'm here.
Operator: The next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jordan Alliger: Yes, hi. So given sort of the color and commentary on customers still expect peak season and load still to advance inland against the pull forward, is there any way you could sort of put that together a little bit and think through sort of loads and volumes for you guys relative to what we just saw in the third quarter as we look out the next quarter or so? Just from a high-level perspective, thanks.
Spencer Frazier: Yes. Hey, John, this is Spencer. Thanks for the question. The main point that I really wanted to make there, there's been quite a few headlines that come out and say, hey, peak is over. There's not going to be a peak. And I totally agree with that from an ocean perspective. But we always have to remember that that domestic, that inland supply chain, the timing of that is really driven by actual consumer and customer demand. And that's going to take place at the same time it does every year, associated with the holidays. So that was kind of point number one. And then back to our customers are expecting a peak season. I think even the NRS came out with their retail sales number or retail sales for September being up 5.7%. Our customers are working to keep their consumers, to keep all of us engaged and make sure that they can hit their sales targets and goals for the holiday season. And that they're expecting to do that. Now for us, definitely the deals and agreements and support that we have for our customers is unique. And each one of our customers is unique on how they're executing their peak volume. But the big thing when you think about going forward to your question, you look at last year, last year was artificially inflated due to the East Coast strike concerns and other issues. And that really started in the '4. And carried through to really where West Coast port volumes were up 20% significantly all the way through the year. I expect the comps associated with that change and really the current import volumes to really be challenged all the way through March '6. So I think that where we're at today and what we've done and what we're going to do to help our customers through peak, we're looking forward to doing that. And working with those customers that have provided us with the forecast and what their needs are.
Operator: The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ravi Shanker: Great, thanks. I'm going to throw in a long-term question here and maybe sharing this topic close to your heart. Just kind of given you guys probably led peers on JV360 and all the tech investments kind of many years ago, can you talk about kind of what you guys are working on right now? What that technology capital envelope looks like? Key initiatives there and kind of how the ICS business would look like from a tech and automation perspective maybe three, four years from now? Thank you.
Shelley Simpson: Thank you, Ravi. And love to talk about technology. Our strategy is rooted in how we transform our logistics. We want to be smarter, more predictive, and automated through JBM360. And if you just think about what our platform does, it supports $2 billion in carrier freight transactions, and that gives us scale to innovate. And we could do that quickly and effectively. As I think about what we're working on, we've deployed 50 AI agents. That's across the business. We're trying to automate tasks, streamline our operations. And maybe just a few examples. Today, 60% of our third-party care check calls, those are automated. More than 73% of our orders are auto accepted, 80% of our paper invoices are paid without a manual touch. Our dynamic quote API responds to 2 million quotes a year. And we've automated about 100,000 or a little more than one hundred thousand hours annually across our highway, dedicated, and CE teams. And so it's not just about AI for us, it is about how we think about technology, but how does it empower our people. And so whether that's engineering better processes or using robotic automation, leveraging AI, we're focused on helping our teams work smarter and become more efficient. And that's going to improve our operational performance and enhance our customers' visibility and their experience. So as we continue to refine our technology strategy, our goal remains very clear to us. We're going to deliver measurable gains in cost savings, we're going to increase our customer satisfaction, and we want to gain market share as a result. Now as I think about ICS, they have a great opportunity to do even more work when it comes to automation because the nature of the new customers they're onboarding are less sophisticated from a technology perspective. So it's really a new for them. If you think about our overall company, our company and the percentage of customers that we have that are large shippers, we're heavily distorted to. And so I would say that's our opportunity to really grow with those small to midsized customers and that's where automation will help significantly. We've got a clear path of things that we're working on. And then I want to make sure that I do mention we did talk about Up Labs, which is a company that we've partnered with and really having them attack two of our areas that we believe need rewritten from a process and even more importantly technology where they're integrating AI into those processes. Those two areas I would say, we're in the middle of, really investigating and determining next path forward. But for us, all of this is about efficiency across our entire system. And so that's part of our lowering our cost to serve. It's part of our transformation work. And I don't think it just has to be AI that makes that happen. It could be a combination of processes, robotics, and AI.
Operator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors with SIG. Please go ahead.
Bascome Majors: Brad, as you get into the planning period for next year, can you talk a little bit about some of the higher visibility big-ticket cost items in the budget, be it health and welfare or insurance? Just what is the inflationary backdrop you're continuing with now? And how do you think shifts into next year? And you put it on the blender with the $50 million plus incremental cost savings, how much do you really need to get from pricing and growth to offset that? Thank you.
Brad Delco: Well, Bascome, the way you started with that question, I was just going to say yes, yes, yes, and yes. I would say the big areas where we're seeing inflationary pressure always on our people and wages but in particular around benefits. Group medical healthcare costs are, I don't think it's unique to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. I think it's a challenge for any and all businesses. So that's certainly an area that I think is a hot topic as we're thinking about planning for 2026. Insurance, yes, we're in the renewal process now. It's probably too early to comment on that. But particularly as you get into certain layers or areas of coverage, we're seeing greater cost and largely because of how and how these claims are settling. And I think it's again, it's not that's not unique to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. The thing that I'm really proud of is, and you heard Shelley and Nick both talk to it and our whole company should be proud of, is our safety performance. I mean, we're coming off of a very strong year last year, which was best, which bested the prior year. And year to date, I'll knock on wood here, our performance is better than last year and the best way to reduce our cost on claims and insurance items is to really to avoid any incidents. And so that's the goal. The goal is zero and we got a long ways to go to get there. In terms of what do we need, our customers I know are going to push hard unless there is a meaningful change or a change in the supply-demand balance. I think Nick alluded to the fact that there are maybe some things that are starting to pop up that might be reasons for more concern about what the capacity situation looks like going forward. But we got to at least get above inflation. And if inflation is running 3%, I feel like our industry needs something better than that to get into a healthier spot. And our industry is not in a healthy spot. And I think most of you who have covered this for a long time know that. So our goal and we had a lot of follow-up conversations after our last earnings call about is $100 million net or gross, and I jokingly will say this here, I've asked each of those investors to define it for me and they all gave me a different example. At the end of the day, lowering our cost to serve of $100 million, we want that to show up and be very visible to our owners. And we want to be obviously visible to you as well. But I would say we need something mid-single digits next year for our to at least get back on a healthier path to margin recovery and particularly for some of these transportation providers to reinvest or be at reinvestable levels. So that's a long answer. I know I didn't answer it specifically because I don't want to give guidance as to what our rate expectations might be next year. But I would hope the value that we're providing customers will allow us to earn an appropriate return on the investments and the risk we're taking serving those customers.
Operator: The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.
Tom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. Want to give Shelley a shot at a question here if she wants to take it or I guess could pass along certainly. But when I think about coming out of a downturn in the industry, it seems like there we look for kind of a catalyst to change the shipper mindset. And I know you've got tons of experience working with shippers over time. So do you think this the DOT efforts that you listed a number of them, I think there's a lot of focus on the non-domiciled CDL issue right now. But do you think that those DOT efforts are really causing a lot of concern in the mindset? And there's potentially a shift in that mindset that seems important to pricing. And then I guess within that is the 200,000 number DOT talked about, is that you think that sounds right? Or does that not sound right? Thank you.
Shelley Simpson: Yes. Thank you, Tom. And let me start and I'll have the team kind of jump in here. Overall. When I think about how our shippers are viewing the market, it has been a surprise to all of us. So to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and our shippers, how this market still is in the same place it's been over the more than three years. And so I would tell you, our customers a year ago they were prepared and understood the why. That we would need more price. It's not that our customers are unsympathetic to our position, but they're managing their costs based on what they see from a bid perspective and what they see from a cost perspective. And so, I think it's incumbent on us. One of the things I think is important is we are a growth company, but we're a disciplined growth company. We can't just grow. We have to be disciplined in our growth strategy. And making sure we articulate that. I'll tell you this Tom, as much as Darren's talked about our pricing change, although that might seem really simple to do, in this environment, those were very difficult discussions, but they were really fueled by our operational excellence and being able to talk to our customers about what great work we're doing and they saw value in that. I've not seen us have to fight so hard for 12% before. When you know inflation is so much more than that overall. So I would tell you, I think customers want to help us. We need the market to change in order to do that. Do I think that non-domicile CDL could be a catalyst? Sure. It would at least make a little more sense to me why there's so much capacity in the market versus just our statistics say today. But I would tell you things have to change from here. If that's one of the things that happens, then does that happen in the next twelve months? Does that take twenty-four months for it to happen? But let me just take a pause there and let Nick maybe you want to jump in on the non-doms.
Nick Hobbs: No, yes. And I might just add a couple of quick things here, Shelley. I totally agree. Our customers really the last two years have been planning for changes in cost that really didn't materialize because they didn't have to. I think some of the things that we're seeing right now with a little bit of a disconnect in spot price rates going up versus volumes going down, the first time we've seen that. Maybe in the history of some of the data. Our customers look at macro data and spot pricing and volumes. Let me go back to until they actually experience it or feel it at the dock level, until freight is not picked up. They won't make a meaningful change. So that's the area where we've got to give them confidence and predictability of our capacity and service, which we've done through operational excellence. That as this thing does change, whether it's near term or over time, they can count on us to take care of their business. Nick?
Nick Hobbs: I'll just add a couple of things. On the non-dom, I think the $200,000 is fairly legit. But I think there's a lot of other factors of drivers that's coming across the border, call it, cabotage. It should only be in the border zone. Is some good data out there. From a couple of sources that's come out recently to talk about that. And so I just think there's other factors that's going to continue to impact that. But really to see any impact in the speed, it's going to take the economic side along with the regulation side and that's what's going to drive the timing is those two. In my opinion.
Operator: The last question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Eric Morgan: Hey, good afternoon. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon actually. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on intermodal growth in the East. I think you referenced in the prepared remarks having the labor port issue kind of playing in there. So I'm just wondering how sustainable that level of growth is moving forward and maybe in the context of some of this different seasonality you're seeing this year would be helpful. Thanks.
Darren Field: Sure. So I think in reference to the labor situation, that had more to do with last year's comps on the West Coast. Volumes being strong. Our Eastern network volume really doesn't have a lot of interaction with the import economy a ton. I think that the Eastern network continues to be where we see the best highway to rail conversion opportunity. Our East network also includes Mexico as an example. And so we have really nice solid growth coming northbound out of Mexico as part of that. We think that the vast majority of the millions of loads that remain to be converted from highway to intermodal are in the East. So we're encouraged by our growth in the East, and we expect and anticipate we can continue to grow in the East for years to come.
Operator: This concludes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mrs. Shelley Simpson for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Shelley Simpson: Hey, thanks everyone for joining. Hey, we're pleased with our results in the short term, especially considering this environment. But we have more work to do and we're not satisfied. We're going to continue to remain focused on our priorities of operational excellence in both service and safety. We're going to scale into our investments through disciplined growth, and then we're going to keep repairing our margins, and that will drive stronger financial performance. We're a growth company. It's important, and we have the highest service across all five of our business units. I think the highest since I've been with the company from a consistency across the segments. We see that metric as a key enabler to execute on our strategy and maintain our say-do culture on delivering what we say and what we expect from ourselves. Thanks for your interest, and we'll see you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

  • Differences/trend: 2025-Q3 is a clear improvement vs 2024-Q3. Current (roughly flat) is higher than the prior comparable quarter (−3%).
  • Explicit statement: 2025-Q3 revenue is higher (better) than 2024-Q3's −3%.

- 2025-Q3 operating income growth — "operating income improved 8% versus the prior year period"
  • Most-similar past fact: 2024-Q3 Operating Income — "declined 7%".
  • Similarities: both are year-over-year Q3 operating income comparisons.
  • Differences/trend: reversal from a −7% decline to +8% improvement — a meaningful bottom-line turnaround.
  • Explicit statement: 2025-Q3 operating income is materially higher than 2024-Q3.

- 2025-Q3 diluted EPS growth — "diluted earnings per share improved 18% versus the prior year period"
  • Most-similar past fact: 2024-Q3 Diluted Earnings Per Share — "decreased 17%".
  • Similarities: both are Q3 YoY EPS results.
  • Differences/trend: complete reversal from −17% to +18% — strong improvement in net income per share.
  • Explicit statement: 2025-Q3 diluted EPS is substantially higher than 2024-Q3.

- Year-to-date share repurchases — "purchasing over $780 million or 5.4 million shares of our stock year to date"
  • Most-similar past facts: past items in the list reference 2024-Q3 results (revenue, operating income, EPS, cost control) but do not contain a numeric prior repurchase amount.
  • Similarities: management focus on capital returns appears in commentary historically.
  • Differences/trend: no directly comparable historical repurchase dollar or share count is provided in the most-similar facts, so a numeric comparison cannot be made.
  • Explicit statement: cannot determine higher/lower/similar because no prior numeric repurchase value is in the provided past facts.

- Leverage ratio — "maintaining leverage around our target of one times trailing twelve‑month EBITDA"
  • Most-similar past facts: the provided past items (2024-Q3) do not include a numeric leverage ratio.
  • Similarities: past commentary emphasized balance-sheet discipline; however, no prior leverage number is provided.
  • Differences/trend: no numerical comparison possible; current statement is qualitative confirmation of disciplined leverage.
  • Explicit statement: cannot determine higher/lower/similar due to absent historical leverage figure in the list.

- Cost-to-serve savings realized in Q3 — "having eliminated greater than $20 million in the quarter"
  • Most-similar past facts: 2024-Q3 Cost Control Improvement — "significant improvements across the business" and right‑sizing the cost structure.
  • Similarities: both quarters emphasize cost reduction and right-sizing.
  • Differences/trend: 2025-Q3 provides a quantified result (> $20 million) versus 2024-Q3's qualitative description. The quantified savings in 2025-Q3 confirm execution of the earlier cost-control initiatives and indicate realized structural savings.
  • Explicit statement: 2025-Q3 savings (> $20 million) provide stronger, measurable evidence versus the prior quarter’s qualitative improvement narrative.

- Intermodal volume change — "volumes declined 1% year over year" (and monthly: down 3% in July, down 2% in August, flat in September; Eastern loads up 6%)
  • Most-similar past facts: 2024-Q3 Volume Growth in Intermodal — "up 5% year-over-year" (also 2024-Q4 had intermodal up 5% in the list).
  • Similarities: both are YoY intermodal volume comparisons and management discusses regional/segment patterns.
  • Differences/trend: shift from +5% in 2024-Q3 to −1% in 2025-Q3 — a deterioration in consolidated intermodal volume. However, the reported regional detail (Eastern loads up 6%) matches past emphasis on pockets of regional strength (e.g., Transcon growth historically).
  • Explicit statement: overall intermodal volumes in 2025-Q3 are lower than the most-recent comparable quarter (2024-Q3).

2. Supported outcomes (areas where management addressed historical comparisons and the numbers confirm their comments)
- Bottom-line turnaround
  • Management claim: operating income improved 8% and diluted EPS improved 18% YoY for 2025-Q3.
  • Confirmation vs history: the most-similar 2024-Q3 facts show operating income −7% and EPS −17%. The 2025-Q3 results therefore confirm a clear reversal and improvement in bottom-line performance (operating income and EPS both materially higher vs the prior-year quarter).
- Cost control execution
  • Management claim: structural cost reductions and right‑sizing actions.
  • Confirmation vs history: 2025-Q3 quantifies "eliminated greater than $20 million in the quarter," which supports and makes explicit the prior qualitative commentary about "significant improvements" and right‑sizing noted in 2024-Q3.
- Regional/intermodal nuance
  • Management claim: mixed monthly/ regional intermodal performance.
  • Confirmation vs history: consolidated intermodal moved from +5% (2024-Q3) to −1% (2025-Q3), validating management’s comment about a softer consolidated trend; the Eastern loads +6% detail confirms the presence of regional strength despite overall volume decline.

Overall concise conclusion (bottom-line focus)
- The company’s 2025-Q3 shows a meaningful bottom-line improvement: operating income (+8%) and diluted EPS (+18%) are materially higher than the prior comparable quarter (2024-Q3: operating income −7%, EPS −17%), confirming management’s claims of improved profitability. Cost-to-serve savings (> $20 million) provide tangible support for the operating and EPS improvement. Intermodal volume weakened YoY (−1% vs prior +5%), so margin/earnings gains appear driven by cost control and other income/efficiency improvements rather than volume growth.

  • 最相似的過去事實：2024-Q3 互聯運輸量增長 —「up 5% year-over-year（年比成長 5%）」（清單亦有 2024-Q4 intermodal +5%）。
  • 相似處：均為互聯運輸的年比量能比較，管理層會提出區域與月份差異。
  • 差異/趨勢：由 2024-Q3 的 +5% 轉為 2025-Q3 的 −1%，整體互聯運輸量惡化。但東部貨量 +6% 與過去強勢區域的表現是一致的區域性強項證據。
  • 明確說明：2025-Q3 整體互聯運輸量低於最近可比季度（2024-Q3）。

2. 支持的結果（管理層明確提到歷史比較且數字證實之處）
- 底線轉正
  • 管理層說法：2025-Q3 營業利益較去年成長 8%，稀釋 EPS 較去年成長 18%。
  • 與歷史比較的確認：最相似的 2024-Q3 顯示營業利益 −7%、EPS −17%。2025-Q3 的數字因此確認了營業利潤與每股獲利的顯著反轉與改善，證實管理層所述的底線改進。
- 成本控制執行
  • 管理層說法：已執行結構性成本下降與規模調整。
  • 與歷史比較的確認：2025-Q3 量化「本季已消除超過 $20M」的節省，支持並具體化了 2024-Q3 的成本改善敘述。
- 區域/互聯運輸差異化
  • 管理層說法：互聯運輸表現具有月度與區域差異。
  • 與歷史比較的確認：整體互聯運輸由 2024-Q3 的 +5% 下滑至 2025-Q3 的 −1%，驗證管理層所述的整體趨勢走弱；同時東部 +6% 的細節驗證存在區域性強勁表現。

整體簡短結論（重點：底線）
- 2025-Q3 呈現顯著的底線改善：營業利益 +8% 與稀釋 EPS +18% 均顯著優於 2024-Q3（營業利益 −7%、EPS −17%），證實管理層關於獲利改善的說法。超過 $20M 的本季成本節省提供了對營業與 EPS 改善的具體支撐。互聯運輸量則由成長轉為小幅下滑（+5% → −1%），顯示盈餘提升主要來自成本控制與效率改善而非量的成長。

Historical‑Calls note:
English

1) Validate past guidance (only items with a direct, comparable outcome in 2025‑Q3)
- "Implemented remaining pricing from 2024 bid season / pricing implications" (2024‑Q3): Met. Evidence in 2025‑Q3 shows ICS bid season rates "up low to mid‑single digits, winning volume" (current fact 28).
- "Prefunded trailing capacity needs in intermodal / prepared to support customer growth" (2025‑Q2): Met. Management in 2025‑Q3 states "we have the capacity and ability to execute on a meaningful growth plan" (fact 50).
- "Prepare for bid season / diversify customer base" (2024‑Q3): Met. Q3 2025 reports ICS "winning volume with new customers" (fact 28).
- "Service improvement expectations / drive efficiencies with customers" (2024‑Q3): Met. Q3 2025: "service levels remain excellent. We have systemically elevated our service standards" (fact 11).
- "Repair margins / improve financial performance" (2025‑Q2 / 2024‑Q4 forward‑looking emphasis): Met (progress). Concrete outcomes in 2025‑Q3: consolidated operating income improved 8% YoY and diluted EPS improved 18% YoY (facts 2 and 3). 
Notes: Other past forward‑looking items (tax rate, capex, many strategic initiatives) had no directly comparable, quantifiable Q3 outcome in the provided facts and are omitted.

2) Compare results discussed (concrete numbers)
- Revenue: 2024‑Q3 previously reported "declined 3%" YoY → 2025‑Q3 revenue was "roughly flat year over year" (fact 1). Change: improvement of ~3 percentage points (decline → flat).
- Operating income: 2024‑Q3 "declined 7%" YoY → 2025‑Q3 "operating income improved 8% versus the prior year period" (fact 2). Swing: ~+15 percentage points.
- Diluted EPS: 2024‑Q3 "decreased 17%" YoY → 2025‑Q3 "diluted earnings per share improved 18% versus the prior year period" (fact 3). Swing: ~+35 percentage points.
- Intermodal volumes: 2024‑Q3 "up 5% year‑over‑year" (prior) → 2025‑Q3 "volumes declined 1% year over year" (facts 16 and 37). Change: a ~6 percentage‑point reversal; monthly Q3 trend in 2025: July -3%, August -2%, September flat (fact 38).
- ICS (contract services) pricing/volume: 2024‑Q3 ICS gross revenue had previously "declined 7% year‑over‑year" → 2025‑Q3 bid outcomes show "rates up low to mid‑single digits, winning volume" and ICS volumes "modestly improved sequentially" (facts 28 and 27), indicating a recovery versus the prior declines.
- JBT (truckload): Prior commentary noted excess capacity (~20% in 2024‑Q4) → 2025‑Q3 reports "our highest quarterly volume in over a decade" (fact 25), indicating materially stronger truckload volumes.
- Safety: Prior calls noted "record safety performance" / improved further → 2025‑Q3: "two consecutive years of record performance ... and our safety results through the third quarter are performing even better" and CFO: "our performance is better than last year" (facts 15 and 40) — further improvement achieved.
- DCS (Dedicated) margins/outlook: Historically margin pressures noted; 2025‑Q3: "Despite facing these two margin pressures, we still maintain double‑digit margins" (fact 33) and management expects 2025 DCS operating income "approximately flat compared to 2024" (fact 35) — margins held in double digits even amid pressures.

3) Supporting evidence lines (historical statement → current result)
• Expected pricing from 2024 bid season: "implemented remaining pricing from our 2024 bid season" → 2025‑Q3: "rates up low to mid‑single digits, winning volume" (fact 28).  
• Prefunded intermodal capacity: "Prefunded trailing capacity needs in intermodal" → 2025‑Q3: "we have the capacity and ability to execute on a meaningful growth plan" (fact 50).  
• Preparing for bid season / diversify customers: "committed to further diversifying our customer base" → 2025‑Q3: "winning volume with new customers" (fact 28).  
• Service improvement expectations: "continue to work with them to help drive efficiencies" → 2025‑Q3: "service levels remain excellent. We have systemically elevated our service standards" (fact 11).  
• Margin repair focus: "Repairing margins and improving financial performance" → 2025‑Q3: "operating income improved 8% YoY" and "diluted EPS improved 18% YoY" (facts 2 and 3).  
• Intermodal momentum (prior growth): "Intermodal up 5% year‑over‑year" (2024) → 2025‑Q3: "intermodal volumes declined 1% YoY; July -3%, August -2%, September flat" (facts 16, 37, 38).  
• JBT volume vs prior excess capacity: "approximately 20% excess capacity" (2024‑Q4) → 2025‑Q3: "highest quarterly volume in over a decade" (fact 25).  
• ICS prior revenue decline: "ICS gross revenue declined 7% YoY" (2024‑Q3) → 2025‑Q3: "rates up low to mid‑single digits, winning volume" and "ICS volumes modestly improved sequentially" (facts 28 and 27).  
• Safety trend: "back‑to‑back years of record safety performance" (prior) → 2025‑Q3: "safety results through the third quarter are performing even better" / "performance is better than last year" (facts 15 and 40).  

Conclusion (English, concise)
- Where past forward‑looking comments had observable, comparable outcomes (pricing, intermodal capacity readiness, bid wins, service levels, margin progress), the company met those expectations in 2025‑Q3.  
- Results show clear improvement in operating income and EPS versus the year‑ago quarter, a reversal from the declines reported in 2024‑Q3, but intermodal volumes softened vs prior year and some end‑markets (Final Mile big‑and‑bulky) remain challenged.

結論（繁體中文，簡潔）
- 在可直接比較的歷史前瞻項目（定價、互模容量就緒、標案贏單、服務水準、利潤率進展）中，公司在 2025‑Q3 大多達成預期。  
- 與去年同期相比，營業利益與 EPS 明顯改善（分別 +8% 營業利益 / +18% EPS），扭轉 2024‑Q3 的衰退；但互模在 2025‑Q3 相較 2024‑Q3 出現逆轉（由 +5% → -1%），Final Mile 等終端市場仍顯疲弱。

Peers note:
English

- Fact 1 — Q3 2025 revenue growth ("revenue was roughly flat year over year")
  - Difference: JBHT emphasizes reported revenue being roughly flat. Some peers also reported flat reported revenue (CAH: "Approximately $55 billion", Q3 2025 — flat on a reported basis) while others showed modest positive growth (EXPE: "3%", 2025‑Q1; BDX: "9.6%", 2025‑Q1). JBHT’s messaging is therefore consistent with peers that reported flat results but contrasts with peers reporting low-to-mid single‑digit topline growth. (See CAH Q3 2025, EXPE Q1 2025, BDX Q1 2025.)

- Fact 2 — Q3 2025 operating income growth ("operating income improved 8%")
  - Difference: JBHT’s 8% operating income improvement sits in the same general band as other firms that reported mid-to-high single‑digit operating income gains (ORCL: "9%", 2025‑Q3; ORCL: "7%", 2025‑Q4). JBHT frames modest margin recovery despite flat revenue, similar to peers that achieved operating‑income gains even with mixed top‑line trends. (See ORCL 2025‑Q3/2025‑Q4.)

- Fact 3 — Q3 2025 diluted EPS growth ("diluted earnings per share improved 18%")
  - Difference: JBHT’s 18% EPS improvement is meaningful but smaller than some peers that reported larger EPS jumps (ANET: "$0.73" up 37.7%, 2025‑Q2) and larger adjusted EPS gains elsewhere (WST: "21.1%", 2025‑Q2). JBHT highlights EPS leverage relative to flat revenue, while other firms sometimes reported EPS increases driven by stronger revenue or larger operational/adjusted items. (See ANET 2025‑Q2, WST 2025‑Q2.)

- Fact 5 — Leverage ratio ("maintaining leverage around our target of one times trailing twelve‑month EBITDA")
  - Difference: JBHT reports a very low leverage target (~1.0x), which is materially stronger than many comparables that showed higher leverage (STX: "1.5x", 2026‑Q1; STZ: "2.9", 2025‑Q2; LKQ: "2.6x EBITDA", 2025‑Q2; CVS: "approximately 4.7 times", 2024‑Q4). JBHT is positioning itself as more conservatively levered relative to those peers. (See STX 2026‑Q1, STZ 2025‑Q2, LKQ 2025‑Q2, CVS 2024‑Q4.)

- Fact 16 — Intermodal volume change ("volumes declined 1% year over year")
  - Difference: JBHT reports near‑flat to slightly down intermodal volumes (‑1%). Some transport peers reported modest positive volume trends for combined product lines (CHRW: "approximately 3% year‑over‑year", combined truckload and LTL, 2025‑Q3). JBHT’s small decline contrasts with peers showing modest volume growth in other segments. (See CHRW 2025‑Q3.)

- Fact 30 — DCS new truck sales in Q3 ("sold approximately 280 trucks of new deals")
  - Difference: JBHT reports an absolute unit count (≈280 trucks), while comparables typically report percent volume changes or revenue measures rather than truck counts (CHRW: "approximately 3% year‑over‑year", combined truckload/LTL volume growth, 2025‑Q3). There are few direct historical truck‑count analogs in the peer set, so JBHT’s unit disclosure is a more operational, granular datapoint than many peers provide. (See CHRW 2025‑Q3.)

- Fact 33 — DCS margins amid customer losses/startups ("we still maintain double‑digit margins")
  - Difference: JBHT stresses maintaining double‑digit margins despite headwinds. Peers report a range of segment margins from double‑digit to mid‑20s (DAL: "Double‑digit", 2024‑Q3; CRL: "25.4%", 2025‑Q3; CRL: "23.9%", 2025‑Q1). JBHT’s claim of double‑digit margins is credible but on the lower side versus peers with considerably higher segment margins. (See DAL 2024‑Q3, CRL 2025‑Q3/2025‑Q1.)

- Fact 37 — Domestic intermodal volume in Q3 ("Volumes in the quarter were down 1% year over year")
  - Difference: Same as Fact 16 — JBHT reports a modest decline (‑1%), whereas some transportation peers showed modest positive volume trends in other freight segments (CHRW: ~3% growth, 2025‑Q3). JBHT therefore portrays slightly weaker intermodal volumes relative to peers’ better‑performing segments. (See CHRW 2025‑Q3.)

- Fact 39 — Eastern intermodal load growth ("Eastern loads were up 6%")
  - Difference: JBHT highlights regional outperformance (Eastern loads +6%), which aligns with peers that sometimes call out regional or channel‑specific mid‑single to high‑single digit gains (LW: "Mid‑ to high single‑digit increase", 2025‑Q3). JBHT’s regional strength offsets the modest national decline. (See LW 2025‑Q3.)

- Fact 10 — Cost inflation pressures ("inflation in insurance, wages, and employee benefits and equipment costs were all up")
  - Difference: JBHT points to inflationary cost pressure across multiple line items. Peers similarly flag cost pressures (DAL: "Nonfuel unit cost growth 'Low single‑digit growth'", 2025‑Q1) or general inflation headwinds. JBHT’s multi‑line cost inflation narrative is consistent with peer disclosures but JBHT emphasizes several specific categories. (See DAL 2025‑Q1.)

- Fact 18 — Overall freight demand level ("overall freight demand softened...below normal seasonality")
  - Difference: JBHT frames the market as softer than normal seasonality. Comparable logistics peers also reported softness (CHRW: "continued softness in the market", 2025‑Q3; ON: "Continued softness", 2024‑Q3). JBHT’s description aligns with the broader peer tone of persistent market softness. (See CHRW 2025‑Q3, ON 2024‑Q3.)

- Fact 19 — Truckload capacity trend ("truckload capacity continued to exit the market, and the pace of exits is accelerating")
  - Difference: JBHT points to accelerating exits (reducing capacity). Peers referenced capacity/market balance dynamics (CHRW: "Load to truck ratios retreated", 2024‑Q2) and expectations of capacity reduction driving future rate improvement. JBHT emphasizes the exit pace accelerating, which is a stronger wording than many peers’ more measured statements. (See CHRW 2024‑Q2.)

- Fact 20 — Spot rate environment ("truckload spot rates remained under pressure in the quarter")
  - Difference: JBHT reported spot rates under pressure for the quarter. Peers likewise described weak spot markets (CHRW: "Low demand causing spot rates to bounce along the bottom", 2025‑Q3). JBHT’s assessment is consistent with peers that experienced pressured spot pricing during the period. (See CHRW 2025‑Q3.)

- Fact 21 — Soft demand in Final Mile end‑markets ("soft demand for furniture, exercise equipment, and appliances")
  - Difference: JBHT calls out specific end‑markets with softness. Peers also reported soft end‑market demand (ON: "Continued softness in the market", 2024‑Q3; LKQ: "Soft overall market conditions", 2024‑Q1). JBHT’s end‑market specificity complements peer commentary but reflects the same weak demand reality. (See ON 2024‑Q3, LKQ 2024‑Q1.)

- Fact 25 — JBT (truckload) volume performance ("highest quarterly volume in over a decade")
  - Difference: JBHT highlights an exceptional truckload volume milestone. Peers reported steady volume gains (CHRW: "seventh consecutive quarter of volume growth"; CHRW: "NAST truckload volume 1.5% increase", 2024‑Q2). JBHT’s language emphasizes an outsized milestone relative to peers’ more modest, multi‑quarter growth statements. (See CHRW 2025‑Q3, CHRW 2024‑Q2.)

- Fact 28 — ICS bid season pricing result ("rates up low to mid‑single digits, winning volume with new customers")
  - Difference: JBHT reports bid‑season pricing up low to mid‑single digits and customer wins. That aligns with sector pricing commentary of low single‑digit increases (STZ: "1% to 2%", 2024‑Q4; COO: "low single digits in that 2% to 3% range", 2024‑Q1). JBHT’s result is consistent with peer bid‑season outcomes. (See STZ 2024‑Q4, COO 2024‑Q1.)

- Fact 41 — Regulatory developments impacting capacity (English proficiency, visas, FMCSA, biometric ID, non‑domiciled CDLs)
  - Difference: JBHT cites a range of regulatory changes that could materially affect capacity. Peers discussed enforcement and capacity balance impacts in less‑specific terms (CHRW: expectations that reduced excess capacity could tighten market; various peers linked enforcement to market effects). JBHT’s multi‑item regulatory list is more detailed and forward‑looking than many peers’ higher‑level comments. (See CHRW 2025‑Q2.)

- Fact 43 — Challenging freight environment ("this challenging freight environment", "backdrop...pretty terrible")
  - Difference: JBHT’s language is blunt about market adversity. Peers used similar qualifiers (CHRW: "challenging market conditions", 2025‑Q2; CHRW: "continued soft freight environment", 2025‑Q3). JBHT’s tone matches peers’ candid assessments, though JBHT uses stronger color language in places. (See CHRW 2025‑Q2/2025‑Q3.)

- Fact 44 — Retail sales environment ("retail sales for September being up 5.7%")
  - Difference: JBHT cites a relatively strong retail sales datapoint (+5.7% for September). Peers reference more moderate retail gains or mixed retail trends (DOW: "Up 2.3% year‑to‑date through June", 2024‑Q2; NKE noted traffic and retail sales "falling below our expectations", 2025‑Q2). JBHT’s retail statistic is comparatively stronger than some peer retail observations, suggesting a partial offset to freight softness. (See DOW 2024‑Q2, NKE 2025‑Q2.)

- Fact 45 — Expectation of a peak season ("our customers are still expecting a peak season")
  - Difference: JBHT expects a peak season despite current softness. Peers likewise generally expect seasonal improvement (UPS: "Positive" about peak and managing it, 2024‑Q3; CHRW: "Seasonally stronger quarter expected", 2025‑Q1). JBHT’s view is aligned with peer seasonal expectations. (See UPS 2024‑Q3, CHRW 2025‑Q1.)

- Fact 47 — Intermodal growth opportunity from rail consolidation ("present...additional growth opportunities")
  - Difference: JBHT anticipates growth from potential rail consolidation and positions intermodal as a beneficiary. Peers discuss similar medium‑term growth opportunities or targets (FISV: "Consistent mid‑single‑digit growth" medium term; CHRW expects demand shifts to affect modal mix). JBHT is more explicit that consolidation would create incremental intermodal share gains. (See FISV 2025‑Q3, CHRW 2025‑Q2.)

- Fact 50 — Intermodal growth capacity ("we have the capacity and ability to execute on a meaningful growth plan")
  - Difference: JBHT emphasizes existing capacity and execution readiness to grow intermodal. Peers often state medium‑term growth targets but less frequently claim immediate excess capacity to execute (FISV: "Mid‑single‑digit revenue growth target", 2025‑Q3). JBHT’s operational claim is more assertive about near‑term execution ability. (See FISV 2025‑Q3.)

- Fact 51 — Spot rate movement tied to enforcement ("that's the reason you've seen spot rates up... because of enforcement activity")
  - Difference: JBHT links recent spot rate upticks directly to enforcement activity. Peers discuss enforcement/capacity effects and expect reduction of excess capacity to support rates (CHRW: "Expect a stronger demand and/or reduction of excess capacity", 2025‑Q2). JBHT’s explicit causal tie to enforcement mirrors peer reasoning that enforcement can alter capacity and pricing. (See CHRW 2025‑Q2.)

- Fact 52 — Industry financial health ("Our customers realize the financial health of the transportation industry is not great.")
  - Difference: JBHT calls out customer awareness of poor industry financial health. Peers likewise flagged commercial transportation weakness (TEL: "5% organic decline", 2025‑Q2; TEL: "Weakness in Europe", 2024‑Q4). JBHT’s observation is consistent with peer recognition of industry stress. (See TEL 2025‑Q2/2024‑Q4.)

- Fact 53 — Target for mid‑single‑digit rate increases ("we need something mid‑single digits next year...")
  - Difference: JBHT explicitly states the industry needs mid‑single‑digit price increases next year to restore margin health. Peers and other companies often use mid‑single‑digit targets for revenue or pricing (FISV: "Consistent mid‑single‑digit growth", 2025‑Q3; CMG: "Mid‑ to high single‑digit range", 2024‑Q1). JBHT’s articulation is consistent with peer framing that mid‑single‑digit moves are the path to recovery. (See FISV 2025‑Q3, CMG 2024‑Q1.)

Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)

- 事實 1 — 2025 年第 3 季營收成長（「營收與去年大致持平」）
  - 差異：JBHT 強調報告顯示營收大致持平。部分同業也報告營收持平（CAH：2025‑Q3 「約 550 億美元」，報告基礎持平），但其他公司則呈現小幅正成長（EXPE：2025‑Q1 「3%」；BDX：2025‑Q1 「9.6%」）。因此 JBHT 的論述與報告持平的同業一致，但與報告顯示低至中個位數營收成長的同業有所不同。 (參見 CAH 2025‑Q3、EXPE 2025‑Q1、BDX 2025‑Q1。)

- 事實 2 — 2025 年第 3 季營業利益成長（「營業利益較去年同期成長 8%」）
  - 差異：JBHT 的 8% 營業利益成長與其他報告中等到高個位數成長的公司相近（ORCL：2025‑Q3 「9%」；ORCL：2025‑Q4 「7%」）。JBHT 以營業利益改善來說明在營收趨平下仍有邊際回復，和部分同業情形相似。 (參見 ORCL 2025‑Q3/2025‑Q4。)

- 事實 3 — 2025 年第 3 季稀釋每股盈餘（EPS）成長（「稀釋 EPS 較去年同期成長 18%」）
  - 差異：JBHT 的 18% EPS 改善具意義，但小於一些同業的更高增幅（ANET：2025‑Q2 「$0.73」上升 37.7%；WST：2025‑Q2 「21.1%」）。JBHT 強調在營收未明顯增長下的 EPS 杠桿效應，而其他公司有時因較高營收或調整項目而呈現更大 EPS 彈升。 (參見 ANET 2025‑Q2、WST 2025‑Q2。)

- 事實 5 — 槓桿比率（「維持在我們目標的約 1 倍追蹤十二個月 EBITDA」）
  - 差異：JBHT 報告的槓桿約 1.0x，明顯低於多數同業（STX：2026‑Q1 「1.5x」；STZ：2025‑Q2 「2.9」；LKQ：2025‑Q2 「2.6x EBITDA」；CVS：2024‑Q4 「約 4.7 倍」）。JBHT 因此呈現相對保守、較低負債槓桿的位置。 (參見 STX 2026‑Q1、STZ 2025‑Q2、LKQ 2025‑Q2、CVS 2024‑Q4。)

- 事實 16 — 洽轉為鐵路聯運（Intermodal）之量變動（「轉向鐵路聯運，量較去年下降 1%」）
  - 差異：JBHT 報告聯運量約微幅下滑（‑1%）。部分同業在其他貨種或綜合口徑仍呈小幅成長（CHRW：2025‑Q3 「約 3% 同比成長」，合併貨櫃/拼箱等）。JBHT 的小幅下降與同業在某些細分領域的溫和成長形成對比。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q3。)

- 事實 30 — DCS 第 3 季新車銷售（「第三季約售出 280 輛新車」）
  - 差異：JBHT 揭露絕對單位（約 280 輛），而同業較常以百分比或營收衡量（CHRW：2025‑Q3 「約 3% 同比成長」，合併貨運量）。在同業資料集中直接以「卡車台數」表述的案例少見，因此 JBHT 的營運層級披露較為具體。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q3。)

- 事實 33 — DCS 在客戶流失/啟動壓力下的利潤率（「儘管面臨兩項壓力，我們仍維持雙位數利潤率」）
  - 差異：JBHT 強調在壓力下仍維持雙位數利潤。其他同業區間有較大差異，從雙位數到 20%+（DAL：2024‑Q3 「雙位數」；CRL：2025‑Q3 「25.4%」；CRL：2025‑Q1 「23.9%」）。JBHT 的雙位數利潤率屬穩健，但相較某些同業的高區間仍偏低。 (參見 DAL 2024‑Q3、CRL 2025‑Q3/2025‑Q1。)

- 事實 37 — 國內聯運第 3 季量（「本季量較去年下降 1%」）
  - 差異：與事實 16 相同 — JBHT 報告約 ‑1%，而其他運輸同業在不同貨種有小幅成長（CHRW：約 3%），顯示 JBHT 聯運在當期較為疲弱。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q3。)

- 事實 39 — 東部聯運負載成長（「東部負載上升 6%」）
  - 差異：JBHT 強調區域性表現 (+6%)，類似同業對區域或通路性高個位數成長的描述（LW：2025‑Q3 「中到高個位數成長」）。JBHT 的區域強勁與其整體小幅下滑形成互補。 (參見 LW 2025‑Q3。)

- 事實 10 — 成本通膨壓力（「保險、薪資與員工福利以及設備成本均上升」）
  - 差異：JBHT 指出多項成本上漲。其他同業也提到成本壓力（DAL：2025‑Q1 「非燃料單位成本成長 '低個位數'」），但 JBHT 對多個類別具體點名，語氣更全面。 (參見 DAL 2025‑Q1。)

- 事實 18 — 整體貨運需求水準（「整體貨運需求在本季走軟...多數期間低於正常旺季」）
  - 差異：JBHT 將市場描述為低於正常旺季的疲軟。其他物流同業也報告市場疲軟（CHRW：2025‑Q3 「市場持續疲軟」；ON：2024‑Q3 「持續疲軟」）。JBHT 的論述與同業整體調性一致。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q3、ON 2024‑Q3。)

- 事實 19 — 卡車運能趨勢（「卡車運能持續退出市場，且退出速度在加快」）
  - 差異：JBHT 強調運能加速退出。相較之下，同業較常以「貨量/卡車比回落」或預期運能減少來描述（CHRW：2024‑Q2 「Load to truck ratios 回落」），JBHT 的用語更強調退出的加速性。 (參見 CHRW 2024‑Q2。)

- 事實 20 — 現貨運價情況（「卡車現貨運價在本季持續承壓」）
  - 差異：JBHT 報告現貨價格承壓；同業也有類似描述（CHRW：2025‑Q3 「需求低導致現貨運價在底部徘徊」）。因此 JBHT 與同業在現貨價格觀察上趨同。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q3。)

- 事實 21 — 最後一哩終端市場需求疲弱（「家具、健身器材與電器需求疲軟」）
  - 差異：JBHT 指出具體受挫的終端品類。其他同業同樣報告終端需求疲弱（ON：2024‑Q3 「市場持續疲軟」；LKQ：2024‑Q1 「整體市場環境疲軟」）。JBHT 的細分類別說明補強了同業的整體疲軟觀察。 (參見 ON 2024‑Q3、LKQ 2024‑Q1。)

- 事實 25 — JBT（卡車）量表現（「創下十多年來最高單季量」）
  - 差異：JBHT 宣示卡車量達到十多年高點。其他同業雖報連續成長（CHRW：2025‑Q3 「連續第七季量成長」；CHRW：2024‑Q2 「NAST 卡車運量 1.5% 提升」），但通常表述為持續穩定成長；JBHT 的說法更突出一次性里程碑。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q3、CHRW 2024‑Q2。)

- 事實 28 — ICS 招標季定價結果（「費率上升低到中個位數，並以新客戶贏得運量」）
  - 差異：JBHT 報告招標定價為低到中個位數且贏得新量，與業界普遍的低個位數定價一致（STZ：2024‑Q4 「1% 至 2%」；COO：2024‑Q1 「低個位數 2% 到 3%」）。JBHT 的結果與同業招標價格趨勢相符。 (參見 STZ 2024‑Q4、COO 2024‑Q1。)

- 事實 41 — 影響運能的法規發展（英語能力、B1 簽證、FMCSA、生物識別、非本地 CDL 等）
  - 差異：JBHT 列出多項可能顯著影響運能的具體法規。其他同業較常將執法或規範的影響以宏觀形式提及並將其視為可能緊縮運能的因素（CHRW：預期運能減少會改變市況）。JBHT 的清單更細緻，語氣更具預警性。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q2。)

- 事實 43 — 困難的貨運環境（「這個困難的貨運環境」、「市場背景相當糟糕」）
  - 差異：JBHT 以直接語氣形容惡劣背景。其他同業也使用類似措辭（CHRW：2025‑Q2 「困難的市場環境」；CHRW：2025‑Q3 「持續疲軟」）。JBHT 的語調與同業的坦率觀察相近，僅用詞更為強烈。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q2/2025‑Q3。)

- 事實 44 — 零售銷售環境（「九月零售銷售成長 5.7%」）
  - 差異：JBHT 引用相對強勁的零售銷售數字 (+5.7% in September)。其他公司引用的零售或消費數據通常較為溫和或有分歧（DOW：2024‑Q2 「截至六月年初迄今上升 2.3%」；NKE：2025‑Q2 指出流量與零售銷售「低於我們預期」）。JBHT 的零售數據較同業常見數字偏高，暗示零售面向可部分支撐需求。 (參見 DOW 2024‑Q2、NKE 2025‑Q2。)

- 事實 45 — 對旺季的期待（「客戶仍預期旺季」）
  - 差異：JBHT 即使在疲軟環境下仍預期旺季到來。其他同業也普遍期待季節性改善（UPS：2024‑Q3 對旺季持正面看法並有信心管理；CHRW：2025‑Q1 預期季節性較強的季度）。JBHT 的看法與同業對旺季的普遍期望一致。 (參見 UPS 2024‑Q3、CHRW 2025‑Q1。)

- 事實 47 — 來自鐵路整併的聯運成長機會（「我們認為這將為我們業界領先的聯運體系帶來額外成長機會」）
  - 差異：JBHT 對鐵路整併可能帶來的聯運成長抱持明確樂觀。其他同業也談及中期成長機會或中個位數成長目標（FISV：2025‑Q3 「中個位數成長」；CHRW：討論需求變化對模式選擇的影響）。JBHT 在將整併視為直接成長來源方面表述較為積極。 (參見 FISV 2025‑Q3、CHRW 2025‑Q2。)

- 事實 50 — 聯運成長的能力（「我們有容量與能力執行有意義的成長計畫」）
  - 差異：JBHT 強調已具備執行成長計畫的容量與能力。雖然同業提出中期成長目標，但較少像 JBHT 一樣主張已經具有立即可用的執行容量（FISV：2025‑Q3 提到中個位數成長目標）。JBHT 的表述較為自信地強調現有資本化投資帶來的即戰力。 (參見 FISV 2025‑Q3。)

- 事實 51 — 現貨運價變動與執法相關（「這就是為何你看到現貨運價在過去幾週上升，原因是執法行動」）
  - 差異：JBHT 直接把近期現貨運價上升歸因於執法行動。其他同業也討論執法或運能減少對價格的影響（CHRW：2025‑Q2 預期需求改善與/或運能過剩減少會支持價格）。JBHT 的因果說法與同業對執法可能改變供需平衡之看法一致。 (參見 CHRW 2025‑Q2。)

- 事實 52 — 產業財務狀況（「我們的客戶認知到運輸產業的財務狀況並不好」）
  - 差異：JBHT 指出客戶意識到整體產業財務狀況不佳。其他公司也揭露商用運輸市場的疲弱（TEL：2025‑Q2 「5% 有機下滑」；TEL：2024‑Q4 「歐洲疲弱」）。JBHT 的觀察與同業對市場健康狀況的負面評價相符。 (參見 TEL 2025‑Q2、TEL 2024‑Q4。)

- 事實 53 — 需要中個位數的運價提升（「我們明年需要中個位數的幅度，產業才可能回到較健康的利潤恢復路徑」）
  - 差異：JBHT 明確指出產業需要中個位數的價格上調以恢復利潤。其他公司也常以中個位數作為成長或價格目標（FISV：2025‑Q3 「穩定中個位數成長」；CMG：2024‑Q1 「中到高個位數範圍」）。JBHT 的論點與同業普遍認知（中個位數為合理復甦目標）一致。 (參見 FISV 2025‑Q3、CMG 2024‑Q1。)

### Step 1 – Classify management tone

From the transcript and notes, classify management's **near‑term tone (next 1–3 quarters)** as exactly one of:
- Very optimistic
- Moderately optimistic
- Balanced
- Moderately cautious
- Very cautious

Base this on concrete wording (for example: "strong demand", "robust pipeline", "headwinds", "macro uncertainty", "taking a conservative stance", "softening", "slower than expected", "we are cautious").

Explicitly mention this tone classification in your explanation.

---

### Step 2 – Compare results and guidance versus investor expectations

Infer how the **current quarter and guidance** compare to what investors were likely expecting, using these heuristics:

- Positive surprise (bullish for next‑day reaction):
  - Clear beat of prior guidance or prior trends **and** management raises or tightens guidance upward.
  - Growth is accelerating versus recent quarters or versus peers.
  - Mix shift or margin trends clearly improve the quality of earnings.

- Negative surprise (bearish for next‑day reaction):
  - Guidance is cut or framed more conservatively; growth is slowing or margins are under pressure.
  - Management emphasizes macro headwinds, demand softness, elongated deal cycles, or higher uncertainty.
  - Results are only "in line" with previous guidance after a strong run‑up in prior quarters.

- Mixed:
  - Strong reported numbers but guidance is cautious or only in‑line.
  - Solid top‑line but with weakening profitability or cash flow.
  - Beat driven by one‑offs that are unlikely to repeat.

When positives and negatives conflict, for **next‑day price reaction** the change in **forward guidance and tone** usually dominates realised results.
Do **not** assume "beat and raise" always means the stock goes up sharply if guidance is only slightly better or the tone is cautious.

#### Special case 1 – "Record quarter but slowing going forward"

If the company reports record results or a strong beat, but:
- revenue, bookings, or key growth metrics are clearly **decelerating** versus recent quarters, or
- full‑year / next‑quarter guidance implies **slower growth or lower margins** going forward,

then you must significantly **discount** the bullish impact of the "record" numbers.

In such cases:
- Do **not** assign scores of 8–10.
- If growth deceleration or softer forward guidance is the main new information, you should lean **Neutral to slightly Negative** (Direction typically in the 3–6 range), even if the current quarter looks very strong in isolation.

#### Special case 2 – "Relief rally / less‑bad than feared"

If recent quarters have been weak or under pressure and:
- management now shows clear signs of **stabilization or bottoming**, or
- guidance is merely "in line" but clearly **less bad than investors previously feared**, or
- major risks (liquidity, leverage, execution, product issues, regulatory overhangs) are **de‑risked**,

treat this as a potential **"relief rally"** setup.

In these situations, avoid assigning very negative scores (0–2) unless new information is clearly **worse** than what investors were already worried about. Mixed but improving situations should lean toward **Neutral to mildly positive (Direction 5–7)** rather than strongly negative.

---

### Step 3 – Assign Direction score (0–10)

Use the full scale consistently for the **next trading day** reaction:

- **0–1**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **down** reaction (often ≥10% drop).
- **2–3**: Clear negative skew; next‑day move is more likely down than up.
- **4–6**: **Neutral zone**. The overall evidence is roughly balanced.
  - **4**: Slight negative lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
  - **5**: Truly balanced; upside and downside are similar. Avoid forcing a directional call.
  - **6**: Slight positive lean, but still within a broadly Neutral band.
- **7–8**: Clear positive skew; next‑day move is more likely up than down.
- **9–10**: Very strong conviction of a meaningful **up** reaction (often ≥10% rise).

Interpretation for trading:
- Scores **0–3** correspond to a fundamentally **bearish** setup for the next day.
- Scores **4–6** correspond to a **Neutral** setup (even if you see a small lean to one side).
- Scores **7–10** correspond to a fundamentally **bullish** setup for the next day.

Be **conservative**:
- Do **not** give scores ≥9 just because this quarter is "strong" in absolute terms.
- Reserve scores ≥9 for cases where guidance and tone clearly **raise** investor expectations and risks are reduced.
- If there are meaningful headwinds, signs of deceleration, or conservative guidance, staying within the **4–6 Neutral band** is often more appropriate than pushing to the extremes.

#### Calibration of Direction scores

- Scores **0–1** and **9–10** should be rare and reserved only for extreme, very clear cases.
- Scores **2–3** and **7–8** represent clear negative or clear positive skews.
- Scores **4–6** form the **Neutral band**:
  - 4 = Neutral with a mild negative lean,
  - 5 = balanced Neutral,
  - 6 = Neutral with a mild positive lean.

Use this rule:

- If you can list at least **three independent bullish drivers** and at most one minor bearish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **7 or higher** (not stay in 6).
- If you can list at least **three independent bearish drivers** and at most one minor bullish driver,
  you should generally use a Direction score of **3 or lower** (not stay in 4).

- If you can list two or more meaningful drivers on **each side** (both bullish and bearish),
  the situation is truly mixed: use a Direction score of **5 (Neutral)**.

If you are unsure whether to pick 4/6 or 3/7, be honest and stay in the **4–6 Neutral band**, with 5 as the default.

---

### Step 4 – Final verdict (short‑term, next trading day)

1. Briefly list:
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **up** tomorrow.
   - The main drivers that could push the stock **down** tomorrow.
   Then state which side you believe (if any) dominates the **next‑day** move and why.
2. Make sure your Direction score is consistent with your reasoning
   (for example, if you highlight several serious risks and a cautious tone, avoid a very high score).
